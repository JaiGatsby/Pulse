In \nhis talk, Dr. Lin With discussed the availability of personal agents such \nas Cortana, Siri and Google. Now, it seems a world of humans and machines \ncommunicate and solve problems together in natural language is not far \naway. The scene of freely chatting with HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey and \nSamantha in Her could happen to us seems within reach. The question is are \nwe ready to go there? He used solving math number word problem as an \nexample to show how the emerging NLP, knowledge engineering and machine \nlearning technologies can pay the way to this holy grail and what \nchallenges that we have to address to travel down the path?The leader researcher, Dr. Tao Mei gave a talk titled \"\". In his talk, he pointed out that the progress made in deep \nlearning has advanced the research in video analysis. For humans, it is \nvery easy to understand videos since we can easily capture the video even \nwhen we were just born and we can capture and recognize each dynamic figure \nin our view. However, it is very difficult for computers to recognize \nscreen content and capture motions, which need tremendous computation to \nimplement. When a computer recognizes some keywords from the video, due to \nthe complexity of the semantics and sentence structure, also tenses and \nplural forms, it is much more difficult for a computer to organize single \nwords into a semantic meaningful sentence. Dr. Tao demonstrated his latest \nresearch progress in deep learning for video content analysis. His \nmultimedia research group has achieved the world's best experimental \nresults and their algorithms are considered as the best for video \nunderstanding.HKUST and MSRA have been collaborated for 15 years on promoting the \ncutting-edge research in IT.

This\ngoal has so far remained elusive.  Existing hand-crafted systems can\nprovide in-depth analysis of domain sub-languages, but are often\nnotoriously fragile and costly to build.  Existing machine-learned systems\nare considerably more robust, but are limited to relatively shallow NLP\ntasks.\n\nIn this talk, we present novel statistical methods for robust natural\nlanguage understanding and generation.  We focus on two important\nsub-tasks, semantic parsing and tactical generation.  The key idea is that\nboth tasks can be treated as the translation between natural languages and\nformal meaning representation languages, and therefore, can be performed\nusing state-of-the-art statistical machine translation techniques.\nSpecifically, we employ synchronous parsing, which has been extensively\nused in syntax-based machine translation, as the unifying framework for\nsemantic parsing and tactical generation.  The parsing and generation\nalgorithms learn all of their linguistic knowledge from annotated corpora,\nand can handle natural-language sentences that are conceptually complex.\nExperimental results in two real-world, restricted domains show that the\nalgorithms are more robust and accurate than the currently best systems\nthat require similar supervision.  Unlike previous systems that require\nmanually-constructed grammars and lexicons, our systems require much less\nknowledge engineering and can be easily ported to other languages and\ndomains.\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nYuk Wah WONG has recently received his Ph.D. in Computer Sciences at the\nUniversity of Texas at Austin.

Most available Web video\nsearch engines perform text-based search, which often return some noisy\nresults on the top of the ranking list. Recently, video search reranking\nhas been an effective mechanism to improve the initial text-based ranking\nlist by incorporating visual consistency among the result videos. While\nexisting methods attempt to rerank all the individual result videos, they\nsuffer from several drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a new video\nreranking paradigm called cluster-based video reranking (CVR). The idea is\nto first construct a video near-duplicate graph representing the visual\nsimilarity relationship among videos, followed by identifying the\nnear-duplicate clusters from the video near-duplicate graph, then rank the\nobtained near-duplicate clusters based on cluster properties and\ninter-cluster links, and finally for each ranked cluster a representative\nvideo is selected and returned. Comparing to existing methods, the new CVR\nranks clusters and exhibits several advantages, including superior\nreranking by utilizing more reliable cluster properties, fast reranking on\na small number of clusters, diverse and representative results.\nParticularly, we formulate the near-duplicate cluster identification as a\nnovel maximal cohesive subgraph mining problem. By leveraging the designed\ncluster scoring properties indicating cluster's importance and quality,\nrandom walk is applied over the near-duplicate cluster graph to rank\nclusters. An extensive evaluation study proves the novelty and superiority\nof our proposals over existing methods.\n\n\n*********************\nBiography:\n\nHeng Tao Shen is a Reader in School of ITEE at The University of\nQueensland.

We contribute two changes that trade between accuracy\nof these estimates and memory, holding sentence-level scores constant.\nCommon practice uses lower-order entries in an N-gram model to score the\nfirst few words of a fragment; this violates assumptions made by common\nsmoothing strategies, including Kneser-Ney.  Instead, we use a unigram\nmodel to score the first word, a bigram for the second, etc.  This\nimproves search at the expense of memory. Conversely, we show how to save\nmemory by collapsing probability and backoff less accurate estimates for\nsentence fragments.   These changes can be stacked, achieving better\nestimates with unchanged memory usage.  In order to interpret changes in\nsearch accuracy, we adjust the pop limit so that accuracy is unchanged and\nreport the change in CPU time.  In a German-English Moses system with\ntarget-side syntax, improved estimates yielded a 63% reduction in CPU\ntime; for a Hiero-style version, the reduction is 21%.

Model\ndynamics induce variations in parameter values and can also destablize its\nstructure. Direct application of many of the recently developed sparse\nlearning algorithms and analysis without recognizing model dynamic leads\nto structure smearing, and therefore poor performance. On the other hand,\nan intrinsically sparse model leads to convergence issues in joint state\nestimation and model identification, due to the fact that the model\nparameters associated with close-to-zero state components are ill-defined\nor insufficiently excited. This talk presents two sets of algorithms:\nsparse EKF and sparse EM algorithms, to overcome these issues and\ndynamically track potentially highly sparse systems. Both algorithms may\nbe viewed as extension of sparse regression algorithms, such as lasso,\nelastic net and group lasso, to a dynamic model setting. Results from\nchannel estimation and equalization in broadband acoustic communications\nwill be presented to illustrate the performance of these algorithms.\n\nNote: this material is based on part of the author's thesis work at MIT,\njointly with Dr. Jim Preisig.\n\n*****************\nBiography:\n\nWeichang Li is currently with ExxonMobil Corporate Strategic Research,\nworking in the areas of machine learning, signal processing and acoustic\nsensing.

It works by injecting\nrandom noise into each query result, such that it is provably hard for the\nadversary to infer the presence or absence of any individual record from\nthe published noisy results. The main objective in differentially private\nquery processing is to maximize the accuracy of the query results, while\nsatisfying the privacy guarantees. Previous work, notably the matrix\nmechanism, has suggested that processing a batch of correlated queries as\na whole can potentially achieve considerable accuracy gains, compared to\nanswering them individually. However, as we point out in this paper, the\nmatrix mechanism is mainly of theoretical interest; in particular, several\ninherent problems in its design limit its accuracy in practice, which\nalmost never exceeds that of naive methods. In fact, we are not aware of\nany existing solution that can effectively optimize a query batch under\ndifferential privacy. Motivated by this, we propose the Low-Rank Mechanism\n(LRM), the first practical differentially private technique for answering\nbatch queries with high accuracy, based on a low rank approximation of the\nworkload matrix. We prove that the accuracy provided by LRM is close to\nthe theoretical lower bound for any mechanism to answer a batch of queries\nunder differential privacy. Extensive experiments using real data\ndemonstrate that LRM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art query\nprocessing solutions under differential privacy, by large margins.\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nZhenjie Zhang is currently research scientist in Advanced Digital Sciences\nCenter, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.

In addition, our SHO-FA\nalgorithms are robust to random noise, and (random) approximate sparsity.\nIn particular, for k = O(n^{1??}) for any ? > 0 suppose the measured\nvector equals A(x+z)+e, where z and e correspond respectively to the\nsource tail and measurement noise. Under mild statistical assumptions on z\nand e our decoding algorithm reconstructs x with an estimation error of\nO(||z||_1 + ||e||_1).

It\nis vital to the success of next generation of power grid, which is\nexpected to be featuring reliable, efficient, flexible, clean, friendly\nand secure characteristics. In this talk, I will present an efficient and\nprivacy-preserving aggregation scheme, named EPPA, for smart grid\ncommunications. EPPA uses a super-increasing sequence to structure\nmulti-dimensional data and encrypt the structured data by the homomorphic\nPaillier cryptosystem technique. For data communications from user to\nsmart grid control center, data aggregation is performed directly on\nciphertext at local gateways without decryption, and the aggregation\nresult of the original data can be obtained at the control center. Through\nextensive analysis, we demonstrate that EPPA resists various security\nthreats and preserves user privacy, and has significantly less computation\nand communication overhead than existing competing approaches.\n\n\n******************\nBiography:\n\nRongxing Lu got his PhD degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at\nthe University of Waterloo in April 2012.

We demonstrate that even\nfor large networks, near optimal solutions is achievable in order of\nminutes. Validation of the solutions will also be discussed. To manage the\nvast amount of data associated with large networks, we use the Network\nMarkup Language (Netml) which provides also a friendly user interface.

A multitenant database management system (DBMS) storing\nand serving the data for these applications (tenants) is therefore an\nimportant component of the platforms' software stack. Continuous\nmonitoring of tenant and node performance is critical for resource\nprovisioning, reacting to changes in workload patterns, elastic load\nbalancing, and orchestrating database migration to ensure effective\nresource utilization and minimize operational cost. A self-managing system\ncontroller faces multiple algorithmic and system level challenges. For\ninstance, how to characterize a tenant given the variety of workloads a\ntenant might issue; how to reduce the impact of co-locating multiple\ntenants, i.e., which tenants to co-locate and how many tenants per server;\nhow to adapt to changes in behavior, i.e., how to detect changes in tenant\nbehavior, how to determine the root cause of the change, and how to\nmitigate the impact of changed behavior; and how to associate a service\nlevel objective to a tenant in a consolidated setting? In this\npresentation, I will discuss some of the challenges we have faced in the\ntrenches of designing a self-managing coordinating component that monitors\nsystem performance, controls tenant placement, and manages elasticity. Our\napproach is to \"learn\" tenant behavior through observation and analyze the\ntenants to characterize their behavior. We use a collection of system\nlevel and DBMS agnostic database level performance measures to represent\ntenant and node behavior, a combination of machine learning techniques to\ncharacterize tenant and node behavior, and a reactive mechanism to detect\nand mitigate performance crises arising from unpredictable workloads and\nbehavior. Our approach continuously learns and models behavior to maintain\na history as well as an up-to-date understanding of behavior.

Previous research on graph classification mainly focuses on\nmining significant subgraph features under single label settings for\nsupervised learning. The basic assumption is that a large number of\nlabeled graphs are available. However, labeling graph data is quite\nexpensive and time consuming for many real-world applications. In order to\nreduce the labeling cost for graph data, in this talk we examine two\nalternative approaches. The first approach uses semi-supervised feature\nselection for graph classification to take advantage of the large amount\nof unlabeled data, while the second approach exploits active learning to\njudiciously select a small number of graph data to query for the label.\nThese problems are challenging and different from conventional\nsemi-supervised and active learning problems because there is no\npredefined feature vector. The subgraph features need to be found\nprogressively during the mining process. Finally, we examine the issue of\nmulti-label classification to assign each graph data with a set of labels\nsimultaneously.The challenge is to estimate the dependence between the yet\nto be determined subgraph features and the multiple labels of graphs.\nEffective approaches to address these problems and overcome the challenges\nwill be discussed.\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nPhilip S.

How to design a sustainable data\ncenter network architecture and how to manage it are two fundamental\nchallenges for data center research, and form the basis of my PhD thesis\nwork.\n\nIn this talk, I will focus on introducing two coupled systems called OSA\nand DAC. Specifically, OSA is a novel optical switching architecture for\ndata center networks. At its core, by exploiting runtime reconfigurable\noptical devices, OSA flexibly adapts its topology and link capacities to\nvarious traffic patterns and thus achieves high network bisection\nbandwidth. The key idea I hope to deliver via OSA is that: a thin but\nflexible architecture, instead of a static fat one, can better support\ndata center networking in a simple, cost-effective and sustainable way. On\nthe other hand, DAC is a management system that performs address\nautoconfiguration for OSA and other generic data center networks. DAC is\nmotivated by the key observation that data center networks encode locality\nand topology information into their server/switch addresses for\nperformance and routing purposes which makes the traditional address\nautoconfiguration protocols, like DHCP, not applicable any more in the new\ndata center environment. The core of DAC is to reduce the address\nautoconfiguration problem to the graph isomorphism (GI) problem and solve\nit efficiently by leveraging the data center topology properties. In both\ndesigns, we have evaluated and validated our systems via extensive\nanalysis, simulations and prototype implementations.

One of the major limitations of HMM\nis the conditional independence assumption of the observation vector given\nits state. This leads to a poor trajectory model. Although many explicit\ntrajectory modeling techniques have been proposed and studied in the past,\nthe use of dynamic parameters remains the most popular way to circumvent\nthe problem. Semi-parametric trajectory models have been proposed to\nimplicitly model the trajectory using temporally varying model parameters.\nThese parameters are modeled using a linear regression of some basis\nstructure with temporally varying regression weights. Initial work has\nfocused on modeling the temporally varying mean (fMPE) and precision\nmatrices (pMPE). Recently, Temporally Varying Weight Regression (TVWR) has\nbeen proposed to model the component weights of the Gaussian Mixture Model\n(GMM). As a result, TVWR is able to model non-stationary distribution\nwithin the HMM states, yielding an implicit trajectory model. Experimental\nresults show that TVWR outperforms standard HMM systems using both maximum\nlikelihood and discriminative training schemes. Furthermore, it is also\npossible to combine TVWR and fMPE to yield further improvements.\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nDr. Khe Chai Sim is an Assistant Professor at the School of Computing,\nNational University of Singapore.

Guibas\n                Stanford University\n\nTitle:          \"Understanding 3D Shapes Jointly\"\n\nDate:           Wednesday, 7 March 2012\n\nTime:           2:00pm - 3:00pm\n\nVenue:          Room 1511 (near lifts 27/28), HKUST\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe use of 3D models in our economy and life is becoming more prevalent,\nin applications ranging from design and custom manufacturing, to\nprosthetics and rehabilitation, to games and entertainment. Although the\nlarge-scale creation of 3D content remains a challenging problem, there\nhas been much recent progress in design software tools, like Google\nSketchUp for buildings or Spore for creatures, or in low cost 3D\nacquisition hardware, like the Microsoft Kinect scanner. As a result,\nlarge commercial 3D shape libraries, such as the Google 3D Warehouse,\nalready contain millions of models. These libraries, however, can be\nunwieldy, when the need arises to efficiently incorporate models into\nvarious workflows. Mathematical formulations, efficient algorithms, and\nsoftware tools are required to support navigation and search over 3D model\nrepositories.\n\nIn this talk we examine the problem of facilitating these navigation and\nsearch tasks by automatically extracting relationships between shapes in a\ncollection and understanding their common or shared structure. By\neffectively organizing the collection into (possibly overlapping) groups\nof related shapes, by separating what is common from what is variable\nwithin each group and across groups, and by understanding the main axes of\nvariability, we can facilitate a whole slew of operations that make large\n3D repositories much more navigable, searchable, compressible, and\nvisualizable. We will present a quick summary of tools for efficiently\ncomputing informative shape descriptors as well as structure preserving\nmaps between shapes at different levels of resolution. The main part of\nthe talk, however, is aimed beyond pairwise relationships, to the study\nand analysis of many shapes jointly, looking at networks of maps between\nshapes in order to extract joint structure, derive consistent\nsegmentations, infer phenotypic relationships, etc. This is preliminary\nwork on what we believe to be a large open area for research -- the joint\nunderstanding of collections of related geometric data sets.\n\n*****************\nBiography:\n\nLeonidas Guibas obtained his Ph.D. from Stanford under the supervision of\nDonald Knuth.

Using\nmeasured aberration data from a Shack-Hartmann wavefront aberrometry\ndevice, VRR modifies input images to simulate the appearance of the scene\nfor the individual patient. Each input image can be a photograph,\nsynthetic image created by computer, frame from a video, or standard\nSnellen acuity eye chart -- as long as there is accompanying depth\ninformation. An eye chart is very revealing, since it shows what the\npatient would see during an eye examination, and provides an accurate\npicture of his or her vision.  Using wavefront aberration measurements, we\ndetermine a discrete blur function by sampling at a set of focusing\ndistances, specified as a set of depth planes that discretize the\nthree-dimensional space. For each depth plane, we construct an\nobject-space blur filter.  VRR methodolgy comprises several steps:  (1)\ncreation of a set of depth images, (2) computation of blur filters, (3)\nstratification of the image, (4) blurring of each depth image, and (5)\ncomposition of the blurred depth images to form a single vision-simulated\nimage.\n\nVRR provides images and videos of simulated vision to enable a patient's\neye doctor to see the specific visual anomalies of the patient. In\naddition to blur, VRR could reveal to the doctor the multiple images or\ndistortions present in the patient's vision that would not otherwise be\napparent from standard visual acuity measurements. VRR could educate\nmedical students as well as patients about the particular visual effects\nof certain vision disorders (such as keratoconus and monocular diplopia)\nby enabling them to view images and videos that are generated using the\noptics of various eye conditions. By measuring PRK/LASIK patients pre- and\npost-op, VRR could provide doctors with extensive, objective, information\nabout a patient's vision before and after surgery.  Potential candidates\ncontemplating surgery could see simulations of their predicted vision and\nof various possible visual anomalies that could arise from the surgery,\nsuch as glare at night. The current protocol, where patients sign a\nconsent form that can be difficult for a layperson to understand fully,\ncould be supplemented by the viewing of a computer-generated video of\nsimulated vision showing the possible visual problems that could be\nengendered by the surgery.\n\n***************\nBiography:\n\nBrian A.

This is one of the\nmost important and difficult problems in computational molecular biology\nand has tremendous implications for protein functional study and drug\ndiscovery.\n\nRoughly speaking, existing computational methods for protein structure\nprediction can be broadly classified into two categories: template-based\nmodeling (i.e, protein threading/homology modeling) and template-free\nmodeling (i..e, ab initio folding). Template-based modeling predicts\nstructure of a protein using experimental structure in the Protein Data\nBank (PDB) as a template while template-free modeling predicts protein\nstructure without depending on a template.\n\nThis talk will present new probabilistic graphical models for\nknowledge-based protein structure prediction. In particular, this talk\nwill present a regression-tree-based Conditional Random Fields (CRF)\nmethod for template-based modeling and a Conditional Random\nFields/Conditional Neural Fields (CRF/CNF) method for template-free\nmodeling. Experimental results indicate that our template-based method\noutperforms all the other methods of same category, especially on\nlow-homology proteins and our template-free method compares favorably to\nthe popular fragment assembly method.\n\n******************\nBiography:\n\nDr. Jinbo Xu currently is an assistant professor at the Toyota\nTechnological Institute at Chicago (a computer science institute on the\ncampus of the University of Chicago).

So far, achieving \nhigh data rate has been the primary focus of research in cooperative and \nCR systems, without much consideration of energy ef.ciency. However, many \nof these techniques significantly increase system complexity and energy \nconsumption. Escalating energy costs and environmental concerns have \nalready created an urgent need for more energy-ef.cient \"green\" wireless \ncommunications. Therefore, we have to be proactive in designing \nenergy-ef.cient solutions for cooperative and cognitive networks, which \nwill potentially drive the future generation of wireless communication. In \nthis talk, we plan to address the energy consumption issues while meeting \ngrowing data rate requirements in these networks. We focus on several \nimportant topics that are crucial towards reducing the energy consumption \nof the cognitive and cooperative networks. These topics include low energy \nspectrum sensing, energy ef.cient resource management, energy aware medium \naccess control and routing, and ef.cient cross layer design. Further, we \nwill discuss various uncertainty issues that need to be taken into \nconsideration while addressing energy ef.ciency in these systems.\n\n******************\nBIOGRAPHY:\n\nVijay Bhargava, an IEEE volunteer for three decades, is Professor in the\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of\nBritish Columbia in Vancouver, where he served as Department Head during\n2003-2008.

While centralized querying of XML data is increasingly well\nunderstood, the same is not true in a scenario where the data is spread\nacross multiple nodes in a distributed system. Since the size of XML data\ncollections are increasing along with the heavy workloads that need to be\nevaluated on top of these collections, scaling a centralized solution is\nbecoming increasingly difficult. A common method for addressing this issue\nis to distribute the data and parallelize query execution. This is well\nunderstood in relational databases, but the issues are more complicated in\nthe case of XML data due to the complexity of the data representation and\nthe flexibility of the schema definition. In this talk, I will introduce\nour project to systematically study distributed XML processing issues. The\ntalk will focus on data fragmentation and localization issues and present\nsome of our early optimization techniques.\n\nThis is joint work with Patrick Kling\n\n\n******************\nBiography:\n\nM.

While there has been a substantial improvement in the\nperformance of face recognition systems, they still do not meet the\nexpectations and requirements of many forensics, law enforcement and\ncommercial applications. The difficulties in automatic face recognition\narise from the large intra-class variability in the face images due to\nmany intrinsic (expression, aging) and extrinsic variations (pose, ambient\nillumination). In other words, different face images of the same person\nacquired at different times and under different imaging conditions can\nhave substantially different appearances that cannot be correctly matched\nby state of the art techniques. The challenge is to a design salient\nfeature extractor and a robust matcher. This talk will address a number of\nongoing research projects in my lab that illustrate the importance and\nchallenges on face recognition. These include (i) matching face sketch to\nphoto, (ii) age-invariant face recognition, (iii) face recognition at a\ndistance, (iv) heterogeneous face recognition, and (iv)  using micro-level\nfeatures (face marks).\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nAnil K.

Making sense\nout of the flood of data, however, is computationally and statistically\nchallenging.\n\nIn this talk, I will first introduce algorithms that enable exhaustive\ngenome-wide epistasis (gene-gene interaction) detection. Due to the\nenormous search space, epistasis detection in the genome-wide scale was\npreviously considered intractable and commonly addressed using heuristics\nwithout guarantees about the solution quality.  I will show that by\nindexing the genotypes and utilizing upper bounds of the test statistics,\nwe can dramatically prune the search space and reduce redundant\ncomputation. In addition to handling specific tests, our algorithms can be\napplied to a various problem settings by utilizing convexity, a common\nproperty of many widely used statistics in genome-wide association study.\n\nIn the second part of the talk, I will present algorithms for finding\nlocal correlations in high dimensional data. In many applications, we are\ninterested in local latent patterns held by feature subsets, which are\ninvisible via global feature projection methods. We have formalized such\nlocal latent patterns as strongly correlated feature subsets. Due to the\ncombinatorial nature of the problem and lack of monotonicity of the\ncorrelation measurement, it is prohibitively expensive to exhaustively\nexplore the whole search space. Our algorithms utilize spectrum properties\nand effective heuristics to prune the search space, and are capable of\nidentifying local correlations hidden in gene expression and other\nreal-life high-dimensional data.\n\n***********************\nBiography:\n\nXiang Zhang is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Computer Science at\nthe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill advised by Wei Wang.

While the 2-d version of the problem was\ncompletely characterized in the pointer machine model more than two\ndecades ago, until recently this was not the case in higher dimensions.\n\nIn this talk, we describe techniques that can be used to obtain a space\noptimal pointer machine data structure for 3-d orthogonal range reporting\nthat answers queries in O(log n + k) time. Thus we settle the complexity\nof the problem in 3-d. The techniques can also be used to obtain improved\nstructures in higher dimensions, namely structures with a log n/ log log n\nfactor increase in space and query time per dimension. Thus for d >= 3 we\nobtain a structure that both uses optimal O(n(log n/ log log n)^{d-1})\nspace and answers queries in the best known query bound O(log n(log n/ log\nlog n)^{d-3} + k). At the end of the talk we will mention how the new\ntechniques can also be used to obtain improved or even optimal external\nmemory structures, and how we have also proved lower bounds show that the\noptimal query bound increases from \\Theta(log n + k) to \\Omega((log n/ log\nlog n)^2 + k) somewhere between three and six dimensions.\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nLars Arge is a Professor of Computer Science at Aarhus University, as well\nas Director of Center for Massive Data Algorithmics (MADALGO) funded by\nthe Danish National Research Foundation.

However, it\nis always difficult to find the optimal solution of a manifold learning\nbased sparse dimensionality reduction without any relaxation or\napproximation. This is because that it is an $\\ell_2$ norm constrained\nsparse quadratic optimization, while most existing compressed sensing\nalgorithms are developed to solve $\\ell_1$ penalized least square\nregression.\n\nIn this talk, we will introduce a sparse dimension reduction method termed\n\"manifold elastic net (MEN)\", its optimization algorithms and real-world\napplications. MEN incorporates the merits of both the manifold learning\nbased dimensionality reduction and the sparse learning based\ndimensionality reduction. By using a series of equivalent transformations,\nwe show MEN has a similar optimization form of the original sparse PCA\nproblem. One of MEN's variant is equivalent to the $\\ell_1$ penalized\nleast square regression, which can be solved by existing compressed\nsensing algorithms.\n\nIn particular, MEN has the following advantages for subsequent\nclassification after dimension reduction: 1) the local geometry of samples\nis well preserved for low dimensional data representation, 2) both the\nmargin maximization and the classification error minimization are\nconsidered for sparse projection calculation, 3) the projection matrix of\nMEN improves the parsimony in computation, 4) the elastic net penalty\nreduces the over-fitting problem, and 5) the projection matrix of MEN can\nbe interpreted psychologically and physiologically.\n\nFor solving the original MEN problem, we propose backward-forward least\nangle shrinkage (BF-LAS), which also provides a scheme to solve general\nconstrained sparse quadratic optimization. BF-LAS starts from the dense\nsolution, iteratively shrinks unimportant variables' magnitudes to zeros\nin the backward step for minimizing the $\\ell_1$ norm, decreases important\nvariables' gradients in the forward step for optimizing the objective, and\nprojects the solution on the feasible set defined by the constraints. The\nimportance of a variable is measured by its correlation w.r.t the\nobjective and is updated via least angle shrinkage (LAS). We prove the\nsign consistency of BF-LAS in two situations: 1) large $n$, small $p$ and\n$q$; and 2) large $n$, $p$ and $q$, wherein $n$ is the number of\nobservations, $p$ is the number of variables and $q$ is the cardinality of\nthe solution.\n\nExperimental evidence on face recognition over various popular datasets\nsuggests that MEN is superior to top level dimension reduction algorithms,\nand brings novel interesting properties such as feature interpretability\nto dimension reduction.\n\n**********************\nBiography:\n\nDacheng Tao received the B.Eng. degree from the University of Science and\nTechnology of China (USTC), the M.Phil degree from the Chinese University\nof Hong Kong (CUHK), and the Ph.D degree from the University of London\n(Lon).

This work is associated with the development of a new\ntheory of meaningful linguistic behaviour, called the Theory of Norms and\nExploitations (TNE).\n\nTraditionally, it was thought (by Leibniz and others) that the analysis of\nmeaning ought to proceed word by word, like a child building a toy house\nwith Lego bricks. This view of meaning is untenable. Corpus evidence shows\nclearly that words in isolation do not have much meaning - and what they\nhave is not very precise. Words in isolation have only meaning potential.\nIn context, the meaning of a word becomes much more precise. How does this\nwork?\n\nEach use of a word is generally associated with an underlying\nphraseological pattern. Meanings are associated with patterns, not with\nwords (or rather, as well as with words).  Words are highly ambiguous, but\nmost patterns are unambiguous.  Hence, it is necessary to decide what\ncounts as a pattern.\n\nCPA is a technique for identifying and storing meaningful patterns of word\nuse, drawing on prototype theory (Rosch), valencies (Halliday; Herbst),\nand collocational analysis (Sinclair; Church and Hanks; Kilgarriff).\nCollocations are grouped together according to their semantic type\n(Pustejovsky). Mapping sentences in text onto CPA patterns usually yields\nan unambiguous interpretation. Patterns discovered through CPA are stored\nin a Pattern Dictionary. The lecture shows how a Pattern Dictionary can be\ncompiled and discusses some of the linguistic issues that arise.\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nPatrick Hanks is a lexicographer and corpus linguist.

Hard handoff (HHO) and soft handoff (SHO) are two\nbasic schemes to perform handoff. Seldom works are dedicated to study a\nhybrid handoff method by combining these two basic handoff schemes in\norder to gain both advantages from them. In this paper, we propose a\nhybrid handoff method by allocating frequency bands usage to HHO and SHO\njudiciously based on two combinatorial design approaches, symmetric design\n(SD) and quasi-semisymmetric design (QSSD), respectively. Due to the nice\nproperty of the  intersection number of bands between each pair of cells\nfrom block design theory, the ratio of common frequency bands (CFB)\nreserved for SHO between each pair of cells can be guaranteed regardless\nthe users mobility. Hence, the proposed hybrid scheme is proper to be\nadopted in high mobility network environments specially.

The TSB-tree has the \nPOTENTIAL of large scalability due to its unique feature of progressive \nmigration of data to larger mediums. However, its traditional design \noptimized for two levels of the memory hierarchy (the main memory and the \nhard disk) undermines its potential for high efficiency in face of today's \nadvances in hardware, especially CPU/cache speed and memory size. We propose \na novel version index structure called the HV-tree. Different from all i\nprevious version index structures, the HV-tree has nodes of different sizes, \neach optimized for a level of the memory hierarchy. As data migrates to \ndifferent levels of the memory hierarchy, the HV-tree will adjust the node \nsize automatically to exploit the best performance of all levels of the \nmemory hierarchy. Moreover, the HV-tree has a unique chain mechanism to \nmaximally keep recent data in higher levels of the memory hierarchy. As a \nresult, HV-tree is several times faster than the TSB-tree for point queries \n(query with single key and single time value), and up to 1000 times faster \nthan the TSB-tree for key-range and time-range queries.\n\n\n********************\nBiography:\n\nRui Zhang obtained his Bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University and PhD \nfrom National University of Singapore.

However, we often observe that the success of a multilingual\ntool in one situation does not guarantee its success in another.\n\nTo develop a customized multilingual environment for various situations in\nvarious communities, we have proposed the Language Grid; it allows users\nto freely combine existing language services to develop new services for\ntheir own. To make various language services accessible, however, we need\ncollaboration of universities and research institutes worldwide to share\nlanguage resources (dictionaries, parallel texts, part-of-speech taggers,\nmachine translators, etc.).

Compared with traditional 2D brushes, a\n3D brush can be both more intuitive and more expressive by offering an\nexperience closer to wielding a real, physical brush. To support popular\nmedia types such as oil and pastel, most previous 3D brush models have\nimplemented paint smearing and mixing. This is generally accomplished by a\nsimple repeated exchange of paint between the 3D brush and 2D canvas, with\nthe paint picked up by the brush typically mapped directly onto the brush\nsurface. In this talk we demonstrate that both repeated exchanges and\ndirect mapping of paint onto brush surfaces are sub-optimal choices,\nleading to excessive loss of color detail and computational\ninefficiencies. We present new techniques to solve both problems, first by\nusing a canvas snapshot buffer to prevent repeated paint exchange, and\nsecond by mapping brush paint onto a 2D, resolution-matched pickup map\nthat sits underneath the brush, instead of mapping onto the 3D brush\nitself. Together, these act to minimize resampling artifacts, helping to\npreserve fine streaks and color details in strokes, while at the same time\nyielding improved efficiency by never sampling the brush more densely than\nnecessary. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a real-time\npaint system implemented on the GPU that simulates pastel and oil paint.\nOur method is simple and effective, and achieves a level of realism for\nthese two media not attained by any previous work.\n\n\n*****************\nBiogrpahy:\n\nNelson Chu is both a visual artist and a software engineer.

Next we consider the problem of using the network approach to\nprovide a more efficient approach to solve the top-k maximal frequent\npattern mining problem. This is achieved through building a pattern graph\nfrom the transaction database after some initial fast processing.\nDifferent from traditional bottom up strategies such as level-wise or\ntree-growth mining approaches, the graph based method works in a top-down\nmanner.

Creating a 3D model of modest complexity is\ntypically already a daunting task, thus a sensible strategy is to generate\na novel shape as a variation from one or more existing models. In this\ntalk, I will present two of our recent works along these lines. First, we\ndraw creative inspiration from a single photograph and exploit a\npre-analyzed set of 3D candidate models. The user creates a realistic and\nreadily usable digital 3D model as a photo-guided geometric variation from\none of the 3D candidates. Specifically, the final model is obtained by\ndeforming a best candidate model so that its silhouette in the appropriate\nview matches that of the target object in the photograph. In the second\nwork, we synthesize new shapes that replicate a certain style extracted\nfrom a set of input shapes. The particular style studied is the\nanisotropic scales of the shape parts and the key enabling concept is\nstyle-content separation which facilitates the computation of part\ncorrespondence across the whole set of input shapes exhibiting large style\nvariations.\n\n******************\nBiography:\n\nHao (Richard) Zhang co-directs the Graphics, Usability, and Visualization\nLab at Simon Fraser University, Canada, where he is an associate professor\nin the School of Computing Science.

We develop an important\nmethod which identifies political orientation of news stories without\ncomplex news text analysis.

They actively express their preferences\nresponding to the political news articles, showing a high degree of\nregularity in their sentiment patterns. The sentiment expressed in their\ncomments is a strong indicator of the political orientation of an article.\nAlso, comments are usually concise, often express sentiments explicitly,\nand easier to analyze.

These applications are typically built from integrating\nnumerous layers of middleware, libraries and frameworks. While employing\nthese libraries and frameworks eases the development effort, this reliance\non code reuse comes at a cost. Many applications suffer from excessive\nmemory footprint, which is caused by chronic runtime bloat. Bloat impacts\nsignificantly the scalability and performance of real-world\nobject-oriented applications that form the backbone of modern enterprise\ncomputing.  Compilers (e.g. the JIT compiler in a JVM) are usually\nineffective in optimizing bloat away as layers of abstractions grow to be\ndeep and dynamic.  Tuning is a daunting task performed mostly manually by\nonly a handful of skilful experts, and it is extremely labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming.  The central goal of my thesis research is to develop\nprogram analysis techniques to make tuning easier, and in particular to\nhelp programmers quickly find, remove, and prevent runtime bloat.\n\nIn this talk, I will focus on two particular program analysis techniques\nthat can help programmers quickly find and remove bloat. The first\ntechnique is a JVM-based dynamic analysis that identifies low-utility data\nstructures by looking for operations that have high costs and low\nbenefits. These data structures are usually strong indicators of\nperformance problems. Using this analysis, we have found large\noptimization opportunities in real-world applications and classified many\nbloat patterns that can be regularly observed during executions. One such\nbloat pattern is constructing and initializing data structures that are\ninvariant across loop iterations. The second technique that I am going to\ntalk about is a static analysis that attempts to (a) automatically hoist\nsuch invariant data structures out of loops, and (b) report them to the\ndeveloper if it is not straightforward to hoist them. We have achieved\nsignificant performance gains (e.g., as large as 82.1% running time\nreduction) by hoisting loop-invariant data structures in real-world large\nJava applications. At the end of the talk, I will give plans for my future\nwork.\n\n\n******************\nBiography:\n\nGuoqing (Harry) Xu is a Ph.D. candidate at the Ohio State University.

Since a fault occurs along an execution path, program\npath information is essential for both detecting and diagnosing a fault.\nManual inspection can identify a path where a fault occurs; however, the\napproach does not scale. Dynamic techniques, such as testing, are also\neffective in finding faulty paths, but only in a sampled space.\n\nIn this talk, I present a practical framework that statically detects \nfaults in path segments. The framework applies an interprocedural, \ndemand-driven analysis to address the precision and scalability challenges \nof static path omputation. It integrates a specification technique that \nenables automatic generation of analyses for detecting different types of \nfaults. In the second part of my talk, I describe how the computed path \ninformation can be applied to automate the diagnostic tasks.

In this talk, we discuss\nsome fundamental challenges in the effort to bring about a more reliable,\nefficient, and clean smart power grid.\n\nOne of the most serious challenges facing the current power grid is its\ndeclining reliability.  Major power blackouts caused by cascading\npower-line and generator failures are occurring with increasing frequency\naround the world, causing enormous economic losses and threatening\nnational security.  Yet, there is still a shortage of understanding on the\nstructures and properties which lend the power grid susceptible to\ncascading failure.  In the first part of the talk, we present a new\napproach for studying power blackouts from a network perspective.  For\nlarge-scale networks modeled by geometric graphs, we use a simple but\ndescriptive model to show that the cascading failure problem is equivalent\nto a dependent percolation process. Within this context, we obtain one of\nthe first analytical conditions for the occurrence and non-occurrence of\ncascading failure, respectively.\n\nThe poor reliability of the power grid is due in part to the high levels\nof stress caused by heavy demand, particularly during periods of peak\nload.  Indeed, the current grid is inherently inefficient since some 20%\nof grid capacity is needed to serve the 5% highest usage hours.  With the\narrival of two-way smart grid communications, utilities can use \"demand\nresponse\" mechanisms to manage electricity consumption in response to\nsupply conditions.  In the second part of the talk, we present two\napproaches to demand response, involving dynamic pricing and optimal power\nresource allocation over time. These solutions have the potential to\ngreatly reduce peak demand, thereby enhancing grid stability while\ndrastically cutting overall energy usage and associated carbon emissions.\n\n******************\nBiography:\n\nEdmund Yeh received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering with Distinction\nfrom Stanford University in 1994, his M.Phil in Engineering from the\nUniversity of Cambridge in 1995, and his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering\nand Computer Science from MIT under Professor Robert Gallager in 2001.

Wireless links are fundamentally different from the wired\ncommunications in several key operation aspects, including limited\nbandwidth as well as time-varying and error prone channel conditions. As a\nresult, conventional secure data communication schemes cannot be readily\napplied to secure media over mobile wireless networks. In wireless\nnetworks, transmission errors such as packet loss and bit errors are\ninevitable due to ambient interferences and open air operation mode.\nFurthermore, media transmission is also fundamentally different from the\ngeneric data communication in that media content integrity, rather than\nthe data stream integrity, needs to be preserved during the transmission.\nFor example, when authenticating media for wireless networks, the semantic\nmeaning of the media data, instead of the entirety of the data, needs to\nbe verified.\n\nIn this talk, various challenges in secure multimedia over mobile wireless\nnetworks beyond reliable transmission will be presented.

It is assumed that all mobile stations (MSs) are equipped\nwith a single antenna each, and there is one active MS in each cell at one\ntime. Accordingly, the system of interest can be modeled by a\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) Gaussian interference channel (IC),\ntermed as MISO-IC, with interference treated as additive Gaussian noise.\nWe are interested in designing a multi-cell cooperative downlink\nbeamforming scheme to achieve different rate-tuples for active MSs on the\nPareto boundary of the achievable rate region for the MISO-IC, which is in\ngeneral a non-convex problem due to the coupled signal structure. By\nexploring the relationship between the MISO-IC and the cognitive radio\n(CR) MISO channel, we show that each Pareto-boundary rate-tuple of the\nMISO-IC can be achieved in a decentralized manner when each of the MSs\nattains its own channel capacity subject to a certain set of\ninterference-power constraints (also known as interference-temperature\nconstraints in the CR system) at the other MS receivers. Furthermore, we\nshow that this result leads to a decentralized algorithm for implementing\nthe multi-cell cooperative downlink beamforming, where all different pairs\nof BSs independently search for their mutually desirable\ninterference-temperature constraints, under which their respective\nbeamforming vectors are optimized to maximize the individual transmit\nrates. It is shown that this algorithm guarantees to improve the rates for\na given pair of BSs at each iteration with those for the other BSs\nunaffected, and converges when there are no further incentives for all the\nBSs to adjust their mutual interference-temperature constraints.\n\n(This is based on a joint work with Dr. Rui Zhang from I^2R, A-Star,\nSingapore.)\n\n\n************************\nBiography:\n\nShuguang Cui received his Ph.D in Electrical Engineering from Stanford\nUniversity, California, USA, in 2005.

In this work, we consider the idealized \"robust principal\ncomponent analysis\" problem of recovering a low-rank matrix A from\ncorrupted observations D = A + E. Here, the error entries E can be\narbitrarily large (modeling grossly corrupted observations common in\nvisual and bioinformatic data), but are assumed to be sparse. We prove\nthat most matrices A can be efficiently and exactly recovered from most\nerror sign-and-support patterns, by solving a simple convex program. Our\nresult holds even when the rank of A grows nearly proportionally (up to a\nlogarithmic factor) to the dimensionality of the observation space and the\nnumber of errors E grows in proportion to the total number of entries in\nthe matrix. We will also review the rapid development of fast algorithms\nfor solving this problem that, for large matrices, is significantly faster\nand more scalable than general-purpose solvers.

The key to the success of such\nnetworks is to be able to provide the stringent delay guarantees that\ndelay-sensitive applications require, and to maximize the capacity of the\nsystem at the same time. Unfortunately, analyzing delay-performance and\nproviding delay-guarantees in wireless networks have long been a very\ndifficult problem due to both the scarcity of the wireless resources and\nthe unpredictable channel-variation.\n\nIn this talk, we focus on using large-deviations theory to study the\ndelay- and queueing- performance of wireless networks operating under\nqueue-length-based scheduling algorithms. Although large-deviations theory\nallows us to focus on the (simpler) asymptotic regime with small\nqueue-overflow probabilities, it still leads to a complex\nmulti-dimensional calculus-of-variations problem that is very difficult to\nsolve. Hence, analyzing the large-deviations delay-performance and\noptimality remains a difficult challenge. In our recent work, we develop a\nnew theory that combines large deviations with Lyapunov stability to\ncircumvent this difficult. We show that if a control policy minimizes the\ndrift of a Lypaunov function, then the policy is optimal for maximizing\nthe large-deviations decay-rate of the overflow probability that\ncorresponds to large Lyapunov function values.  We will demonstrate how\nthis result can be applied to both packet-based cellular networks and\nmulti-hop wireless networks to easily draw conclusions on the\ndelay-performance of existing wireless control policies, and to design new\ndelay-optimal control algorithms.\n\n\n*****************\nBiography:\n\nXiaojun Lin received his B.S. from Zhongshan University, Guangzhou, China,\nin 1994, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Purdue University, West\nLafayette, Indiana, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.

We also\nstudy how to select the most useful classifiers as the basis for\nadaptation using meta-level features. Our experiments on multimedia\nconcept detection across channels show promising performance.\n\nThe second algorithm describes a probabilistic transfer learning algorithm\nwith task-level features to control the task mixture selection in a\nhierarchical Bayesian model. It is designed for transferring across\ninformation retrieval tasks. This model allows effective transfer to new\ntasks, especially when only limited number or even none of target data are\navailable. To estimate the model parameters, we develop an empirical Bayes\nmethod based on variational approximation techniques. Our experiments on\nTRECVID datasets show that the proposed model achieves significantly\nbetter performance compared with other transfer learning methods.\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nDr. Rong Yan is a Research Staff Member in Intelligent Information\nManagement Department at the IBM T.

Disaster Situation Management\n(DSM) is a complex multi-dimensional process involving a large number of\ninter-operating entities (teams of humans and systems) and is affected by\nvarious social, medical, geographical, psychological, political, and\ntechnological factors. From the information technology viewpoint the DSM\nprocesses can be hindered by lack of adequate, comprehensive and timely\ninformation; the presence of conflicting goals, policies, and priorities;\nlack of effective coordination between different rescue operations\naugmented with inability of many units to act autonomously. Consequently\nthere are important research issues to improve the current methods and\nalgorithms of DSM.During the last decade significant progress was made in\nthe development and deployment of integrated disaster information\nmonitoring systems, including weather, earthquake, fire, chemical,\nradiological and biological activity monitoring systems. The introduction\nof GPS and GIS added significant functionality to the disaster monitoring\nand emergency team dispatching systems. In recent years the progress in\nminiature low-powered sensors and sensor networks, unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs), geo-spatial information systems, wireless broadband\ncommunications, and new emerging solutions of cognitive information\nprocessing, situation management, distributed computing, and\nagent-technologies are opening opportunities for new solutions for DSM.\n\nMany real-time operations of DSM are characterized by significant number\nof inter-acting operational components, high mobility of the components,\nincreasing dynamic and often hardly predictable situations. The\noperational characteristics and goals set for DSM require comprehensive\nand effective methods of understanding, planning and execution of DSM.\nSituation Management (SM) is as a synergistic goal-directed process of\nsituation awareness, situation control, and prediction of potential future\nsituations. The essential components of SM include sensing and\nintelligence gathering, information fusion and event correlation,\nmodelling of the domain entities and their inter-relations, detecting and\nreasoning about the situations, threat situation prediction, and action\nplanning affecting the situations. This presentation gives an overview of\nthe concepts and technology of situation management, presents practical\nsolutions and systems how to architect and deploy situation management\nsystems, and analyses several practical applications and their\neffectiveness.\n\n\n**********************\nBiography:\n\nDr. Gabriel Jakobson is the Chief Scientist at Altusys Corp., a consulting\nfirm specializing in the development of intelligent Situation Management\ntechnologies for defence, cyber security and disaster situation management\napplications.

Scalable and efficient\nunsupervised clustering methods have been the most popular approaches in\nanalyzing these large datasets. Traditional clustering approaches\ntypically partition objects into disjoint groups based on distances in\nfull dimensional space. However, more often than not, some dimensions of\nhigh dimensional data may be irrelevant to a cluster and can mask the\ncluster's existence. This phenomenon, called the curse of dimensionality,\nprevents salient structures from being discovered by traditional\nclustering approaches. We developed unsupervised clustering approaches to\ncapture pattern-preserving clusters in the subspaces of high dimensional\nspace. The proposed subspace clustering algorithms tackle the curse of\ndimensionality by localizing the search of clusters in the subspaces of\nthe original high dimensional data. They go beyond the existing\ndistance-based clustering criteria by revealing consistent patterns that\ncan be far apart in distance.\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nWei Wang is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science\nand a member of the Carolina Center for Genome Sciences at the University\nof North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

A new\ndiscipline - Computational Advertising - has recently emerged, which\nstudies the process of advertising on the Internet from a variety of\nangles. A successful advertising campaign should be integral to the user\nexperience and relevant to the users? Information needs, as well as\neconomically worthwhile to the advertiser and the publisher. This talk\nwill survey the evolution of online advertising systems, and discuss the\nunique challenges posed by searching the ad corpus. At first\napproximation, finding user-relevant ads can be reduced to conventional\ninformation retrieval. However, the complex structure of ad campaigns\nalong with the cornucopia of pertinent non-textual information makes ad\nretrieval substantially (and interestingly) different. We juxtapose ad\nretrieval with Web search and show how to adapt standard IR methods, in\nparticular by augmenting the ad selection process with external knowledge.\nWe demonstrate how to enrich query representation using Web search\nresults, and thus use the Web as a repository of relevant query-specific\nknowledge.

While SOC claims to\nsupport interoperability and support reusability, its foundations start\nwith diversity of different technologies that were not designed for\ninteroperability including ontology, modeling, simulation,  software\narchitecture, programming languages, policy specification languages and\nenforcement mechanisms. The interoperability among these technologies is\nbased on XML only, and requires significant mapping and maintenance of\nmapping.  A new integration approach uses an element model, and the same\nelement model is used for ontology, modeling, simulation, code generation,\npolicy specification and enforcement, and testing. This new kinds of\nintegration allows rapid application from modeling to code generation and\nto code execution.\n\nAnother important issue is testing. Traditional IV&V (Independent\nVerification and Validation) may not be directly applicable if the source\ncode of service is not available. Instead of IV&V, CV&V (Collaborative\nVerification and Validation) may be used that needs the collaboration of\nservice providers, consumers, and brokers to complete testing on demand.\n\nAn integrated process can be developed based on the new concepts of\nintegration and verification to rapidly develop applications. This\nintegrated process has been used for semiconductor manufacturing process,\nsmart home applications, robot controls, and other rapid software\napplications.\n\n\n***********************\nBiography:\n\nW.

While BDDs represent an enormous improvement\nwith respect to traditional explicit methods where states are stored and\nprocessed one at a time, many practical software verification problems\nremain out of reach.

We\npresent a first effort to tackle this challenge by integrating Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) as a separate module into the software\narchitecture of a service robot. Coupled with this module, we also\nintegrated a planning module realized with Answer Set Programming (ASP) in\nthe architecture, aiming at more scalable and flexible planning capacity.\nA prototype system of a real robot has been implemented and tested in a\nsimple home environment. Standard NLP techniques such as syntactic\nparsing, together with our own semantic analyzer, have been implemented in\nthe prototype system. With these NLP techniques, the user's commands and\ndescriptions about the environment expressed in English are transferred\ninto logical formulas in SDRT and finally in ASP, which are fed into the\ntask planning module, through a 5-steps procedure. ASP technique is\nemployed for task planning, making it feasible for the robot to conduct\ntask planning and reasoning about the actions and changes in a unified\nway. It is shown in case studies with the prototype system that the robot\ncan correctly \"understand\" and make optimal plans for compound commands\nunder acceptable real-time requirement, while each compound command\nconsists of multiple atomic actions which may be interconnected with one\nother. Some further challenges are also identified on the basis of this\nwork.\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nXiaoping Chen is a professor in School of Computer Science and Technology\nat University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

In this talk, I will\nintroduce a novel focus+context zooming technique, which allows users to\nzoom into a route and its associated landmarks in a 3D urban environment\nfrom a 45-degree bird's-eye view. Through the creative utilization of the\nempty space in an urban environment, our technique can informatively\nreveal the focus region and minimize distortions to the context buildings.\nWe first create more empty space in the 2D map by broadening the road with\nan adapted seam carving algorithm. A grid-based zooming technique is then\nused to enlarge the landmarks to reclaim the created empty space and thus\nreduce distortions to the other parts. Finally, an occlusion-free route\nvisualization scheme adaptively scales the buildings occluding the route\nto make the route always visible to users. Our method can be conveniently\nintegrated into Google Earth and Virtual Earth to provide seamless route\nzooming and help users better explore a city and plan their tours.

Yoga, wrestling,\ndancing and moving through a constrained environment are some examples.\nExisting scene representations have a fundamental limitation in handling\nsuch close interactions. Currently, a motion is typically described in\nterms of joint angles and kinematic constraints such as contacts. With\nthis representation, automatically computing a valid motion requires\nrandomized exploration and significant computation for collision\ndetection. The animator also needs to shoulder the burden of specifying\nall the kinematic constraints in advance. From the animator's perspective,\nthis is impractical and not conductive to manual editing. Competitive\nautomatic solutions require an effective representation that allows the\nextraction of spatial relationships from existing motion data and\nsynthesis of new animations that preserve these relationships. Such a\nrepresentation will not only allow quantitative evaluation of the way\ndifferent body parts are interacting, but also facilitate qualitative\ncharacterization of scene semantics.\n\nOur research group has been exploring new representations which considers\nthe spatial relationships for describing the interactions of multiple\ncharacters or characters in a constraint environment. In this talk, I\nintroduce two of the proposed methods. The first representation is called\nthe topology coordinates that describes body parts are twisted around each\nother.  The second representation is called the interaction mesh, which\ndescribes which body parts are in close proximity with others. Using these\nrepresentations, we can easily edit or retarget human motions while\npreserving the context of the scene.  The methodologies have a wide range\nof applications in fields of computer animation, pattern recognition and\nrobotics.

All of these\ndevelopments are part of a revolutionary new approach to scientific\ndiscovery in which advanced computational facilities (e.g., data systems,\ncomputing hardware, high speed networks) and instruments (e.g.,\ntelescopes, sensor networks, sequencers) are coupled to the development of\nquantifiable models, algorithms, software and other tools and services to\nprovide unique insights into complex problems in science and engineering.\n\nThis talk will give an overview of NSF development and support of a\ncomprehensive CI essential to 21st century advances in science and\nengineering, including petascale, grid and cloud computing.\n\n\n************************\nBiography:\n\nDr. Almadena Chtchelkanova is a Program Director at the Directorate for\nComputer and Information Science and Engineering at the National Science\nFoundation.

In LAR, hard hierarchical skeletons are built\nand soft linguistic knowledge from source parse trees are injected to the\nnodes of hard skeletons during translation. The experimental results show\nthat LAR is comparable with BWR. When combined with BWR, LAR provides\ncomplementary information for phrase reordering, which collectively\nimproves the BLEU score significantly. To further understand the\ncontribution of linguistic knowledge in LAR to phrase reordering, I'll\npresent a new syntax-based analysis method, which automatically detects\nconstituent  movement in both reference and system translations, and\nsummarizes syntactic reordering patterns that are captured by reordering\nmodels. A comparative analysis is conducted by this analysis method, which\nnot only provides the insight into how linguistic knowledge affects phrase\nmovement but also reveals new challenges in phrase reordering.\n\nA simple yet quite effective segmentation model is also introduced to\ncapture cohesive segments in both phrasal and hierarchical segmentations.\nThe model automatically learns beginning and ending cohesive segment\nboundaries from word-aligned bilingual data without using any additional\nresources. The experimental results show that the segmentation model is\nable to achieve significant improvement over the baseline which does not\nmonitor any segmentations. Experiments further displays the individual\ncontributions of modeling phrasal segmentation and hierarchical\nsegmentation respectively. The proposed segmentation method is not limited\nto BTG-based phrasal translation. It can also be applied to traditional\nphrasal translation, or hierarchical and syntactical translation.\n\n\n**************\nBiography:\n\nDeyi Xiong is a Research Fellow at Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency\nfor Science, Technology and Research of Singapore (A-STAR/I2R).

SybilLimit is based on the social\nnetwork among user identities, where edges correspond to human-established\ntrust relationship. Malicious users can create many identities but\ndisproportionally-few trust relationships. Exploiting this observation,\nSybilLimit providing strong, provable, and near-optimal (within log(n)\nfactor) end guarantees. I will also briefly present experimental results\nfrom real-world social networks to validate SybilLimit's approach.\n\nSybilLimit's social network based approach provides sufficiently strong\nguarantee for most applications except for recommendation systems, which\nare significantly more vulnerable to sybil identities than other systems.\nThus I will further present DSybil, a novel sybil defense mechanism\nparticularly designed for recommendation systems. DSybil uses feedback\ninformation in recommendation systems, and provides strong, provable, and\noptimal guarantees. It exploits the heavy-tail distribution of the typical\nvoting behavior of the honest identities. Our evaluation shows that DSybil\nwould continue to provide high-quality recommendations even with potential\nsybil attacks from a million-node botnet.\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nHaifeng Yu is currently an Assistant Professor at Department of Computer\nScience, National University of Singapore.

Instead, they encourage users to\nexpress them via the interface. Moreover, since users are completely\ninvolved in the preference elicitation process in such systems, users feel\nmore in control of the recommendation process, and as a consequence they\nare more convinced of the products recommended to them. I will finish the\ntalk by explaining the baggage carousel phenomenon and show you how\ncritiquing based recommender systems enable users find personalized items\nwithout expending extra interaction effort.

Devices large\nand small are connected globally from anywhere on the earth.  Therefore,\nwe can argue that we are in a network centric era. With the rapid\nadvancement of technology, we now also have cheap and small devices with\nhigh computing power and large storage capacity.  These devices are\ndesigned to improve our daily life by monitoring our environment,\ncollecting critical data, and executing special instructions. These\ndevices have gradually become an essential part of our Internet.  Many\nimaging, audio and video data are converted from analog to digital. As a\nresult, unprecedented amount of data are collected by these devices and\nare available via Internet. How to manage and look for the desired\ninformation becomes a great challenge.  Therefore, we can certainly also\nsay that we are in a data centric era. In this talk, we will examine the\nchallenges in the convergence of both network centric and data centric\ncomputing. At the same time, many emerging applications like\nservice-oriented, security and real-time demand much better support than\nthe current Internet can offer. To meet these challenges, US National\nScience Foundation also has started a major effort, called GENI (Global\nEnvironment for Networking Innovations) to resign the Internet from\nscratch. However, how the future Internet should look like is still\nundetermined.  In this talk, we will present a vision of content\naddressable future Internet. What are the essential changes in data\nrepresentation, information retrieval, storage systems and networking\ndesign will be discussed.  We believe an object-oriented intelligent\nstorage is an essential part of the solution to this new computing and\ncommunication environment.

However, genome-wide prediction\nof TF binding sites in eukaryotes has suffered from limited information,\nwhich is needed to accurately identify functional elements.\n\nTo this end, we present an integrated approach, called Chromia, that\nintegrates sequence information and epigenetic information. Chromia is\ncomposed of a hidden Markov model that integrates information from\nmultiple sources. Using epigenetic signatures and a motif score as input,\nChromia captures the characteristic patterns of a TF binding motif\noccurrences and the histone modification signature associated with\nregulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. We demonstrated its\nusefulness on genome-wide predictions of target loci of 13 TFs in the\nmouse embryonic stem (mES).\n\nFurthermore, we constructed the genome-wide transcriptional networks in\nhuman embryonic stem cells and the differentiated cells. Defining a node\nas a TF or a gene and an edge as a regulatory interaction, a graph can\nrepresent the transcriptional network in a cell. The regulatory\ninteractions can be inferred by using the integrated model in a condition\nspecific manner. Statistical analysis on the core-network will unveil\ncrucial components for self-renewal in stem cells. Moreover, comparative\nanalysis of epigenetic states identified regulatory elements related to\ncell differentiation\n\n\n**********************\nBiography:\n\nKyoungjae Won received the BS and MS degree in electronics from Chung-Ang\nUniversity, Korea and the Ph.D. degree in electronics and computer science\nfrom the University of Southampton, U.K.  Under the volunteer program of\nthe South Korean government, he worked as an academic staff at the\nNational University of Hanoi, Vietnam.

Unfortunately, building non-rigid 3D models from a\nvideo sequence has proved very hard, and still remains one of the few open\nproblems in visual reconstruction.\n\nIn this talk, I will present a new approach to the \"non-rigid structure from\nmotion\" problem that promises to significantly expand the non-rigid scenes\nreconstructible from video in 3D. The idea is to first solve many local\n3-point, N-view *rigid* reconstruction problems independently, providing a\n\"soup\" of independently-moving and nearly-rigid 3D triangles. Triangles in\nthis soup are then combined into deforming bodies in a bottom-up fashion.

Such\nrapid acquisition incurs imperfections: large regions remain missing,\nsignificant variation in sampling density is common, and the data is often\ncorrupted with noise and outliers.\n\nBuildings often exhibit large scale repetitions and self-similarities. To\nconsolidate the imperfect data, our key observation is that the same\ngeometry, when scanned multiple times over reoccurrences of instances, allow\napplication of a simple and effective non-local filter. The multiplicity of\nthe geometry is fused together and projected into a base-geometry that is\ndenoised to consolidate reoccurrences.\n\nNext, we introduce an interactive tool which enables a user to quickly\nassemble an architectural model directly over a 3D scanned urban scene. The\nuser loosely defines and manipulates simple building blocks, which we call\nSmartBoxes that snap to their proper locations. The building blocks are\nsmart in the sense that their locations and sizes are automatically adjusted\non-the-fly to fit to the point data, while respecting contextual relations\nwith nearby similar blocks.\n\n\n******************\nBiography:\n\nANDREI SHARF is currently a visiting professor at SIAT Institute, Shenzhen,\nChina 2009-2010.

This lies at the intersection of Computer Science, Game\nTheory, and Mathematical Economics, mainly due to the presence of selfish\nagents in highly decentralized systems, the Internet in particular. The\ncomputation of Nash equilibria in games and the computation of Market\nequilibria in exchange markets have received great attention.\n\nBoth problems have a long intellectual history. In 1950, Nash showed that\nevery game has an equilibrium. In 1954, Arrow and Debreu showed that under\nvery mild conditions, every market has an equilibrium. While games and\nNash equilibria are used to predict the behavior of selfish agents in\nconflicting situations, the study of markets and market equilibria laid\ndown the foundation of competitive pricing. Other than the fact that both\nexistence proofs heavily rely on fixed point theorems, the two models look\nvery different from each other. In this talk, we will review some of the\nresults that characterize how difficult it is to compute or to approximate\nNash equilibria in games.

To\nprotect a user's location privacy, we have been developing a new approach\nbased on unobservability, preventing the attackers from associating any\nparticular POI to the user's location.

Either by evolution or\nby design, symmetry implies an efficiency coding that makes it universally\nappealing, especially so to computational science. Recognition and\ncategorization of symmetry and regularity is the first step towards\ncapturing the essential skeleton of a real world problem, while at the\nsame time minimizing computational redundancy. However, symmetry group\ndetection from real world data turns out to be a challenging problem that\nhas been puzzling computer vision, computer graphics and psychology\nresearchers for decades. We explore a formal and computational\ncharacterization of real world regularity using a hierarchical model of\nsymmetry groups as a theoretical basis, embedded in a well-defined\nBayesian framework. Such a formalization simultaneously facilitates (1) a\nrobust and comprehensive algorithmic treatment of the whole regularity\nspectrum, from regular (perfect symmetry), near-regular (approximate\nsymmetry), to various types of irregularities; (2) an effective detection\nscheme for real world symmetries and symmetry groups; and (3) a set of\ncomputational bases for measuring and discriminating quantified\nregularities on diverse data sets. Besides some theoretical background on\ncrystallographic groups in particular, I shall illustrate various\napplications of computational symmetry in texture synthesis, analysis,\ntracking, and manipulation; human gait and activity recognition;\nsymmetry-based dance analysis; grid-cell clustering; automatic\ngeo-tagging; and image 'defencing'.\n\n*****************\nBiography:\n\nYanxi Liu received her B.S. degree in physics/electrical engineering in\nBeijing and her Ph.D. degree in computer science for group theory\napplications in robotics from University of Massachusetts (Amherst).

Still, the growing popularity of the RDF\nformat arguably calls for an effort to offset these drawbacks. Viewed\nfrom a relational database perspective, these constraints are derived\nfrom the very nature of the RDF data model, which is based on a triple\nformat. Recent research has attempted to address these constraints using\na vertical-partitioning approach, in which separate two-column tables\nare constructed for each property. However, as we show, this approach\nsuffers from similar scalability drawbacks on queries that are not bound\nby RDF property value. In this paper, we propose an RDF storage scheme\nthat uses the triple nature of RDF as an asset.\nThis scheme enhances the vertical partitioning idea and takes it to its\nlogical conclusion. RDF data is indexed in six possible ways, one for\neach possible ordering of the three RDF elements. Each instance of an\nRDF element is associated with two vectors; each such vector gathers\nelements of one of the other types, along with lists of the third-type\nresources attached to each vector element. Hence, a sextupleindexing\nscheme emerges. This format allows for quick and scalable\ngeneral-purpose query processing; it confers significant advantages (up\nto five orders of magnitude) compared to previous approaches for RDF\ndata management, at the price of a worst-case five-fold increase in\nindex space. We experimentally document the advantages of our approach\non real-world and synthetic data sets with practical queries.\n\n\nBiography:\n\nPanagiotis Karras is a Lee Kuan Yew Postdoctoral Fellow at the National\nUniversity of Singapore.

This talk reviews the recent development of practical\ndistributed video coding schemes. Wyner-Ziv coding, i.e., lossy\ncompression with receiver side information, enables lowcomplexity video\nencoding where the bulk of the computation is shifted to the decoder.\nSince the interframe dependence of the video sequence is exploited only at\nthe decoder, an intraframe encoder can be combined with an interframe\ndecoder. Wyner-Ziv coding is also naturally robust against transmission\nerrors and can be used for joint source-channel coding by protecting the\nsignal waveform rather than a compressed bit-stream. It thus achieves\ngraceful degradation under deteriorating channel conditions without a\nlayered signal representation. Besides lowcomplexity encoding and robust\ntransmission, the distributed coding paradigm enables novel solutions to\ndiverse problems ranging from coding for random access to media\nauthentication to compression of encrypted signals.\n\n\n********************\nBiography:\n\nBernd Girod is Professor of Electrical Engineering and (by courtesy)\nComputer Science in the Information Systems Laboratory of Stanford\nUniversity, California, since 1999.

And\nwhat is in common between translating English into Chinese and compiling\nC++ into machine code?\n\nIn this talk I will first introduce a tree-based paradigm for machine\ntranslation, inspired by both human translators and compilers. In this\nparadigm, a source language sentence is first parsed into a syntax tree,\nwhich is then recursively converted into a target language sentence via\ntree-to-string transformation rules. Since the translation process is\ndriven by the syntax, this approach resembles the \"syntax-directed\ntranslation\" method used by almost all compilers.\n\nHowever, natural languages are crucially different from programming\nlanguages in that they are fundamentally ambiguous. So we don't (and will\nprobably never) have perfect parsers, and parsing errors adversely affect\ntranslation quality. An obvious solution is to use the top-k parses,\nrather than a single 1-best tree, but this only helps a little bit due to\nthe limited scope of the k-best list. We instead propose a \"forest-based\napproach\", which translates a packed forest encoding *exponentially* many\nparses in a compact (polynomial) space by sharing common subtrees.\nLarge-scale experiments showed very significant improvements (over the\n1-best baseline) in terms of translation quality, which outperforms the\nbest reported systems to date, and confirmed that translating on a forest\nof millions of trees can be even faster than translating on top-30\nindividual trees thanks to dynamic programming.\n\nThis is a joint work with Haitao Mi and Qun Liu.\n\n\n**********************\nBiography:\n\nLiang HUANG recently defended his PhD thesis at the University of\nPennsylvania, co-supervised by Aravind Joshi and Kevin Knight (USC/ISI).\nHe is mainly interested in the theoretical aspects of computational\nlinguistics, in particular, efficient algorithms in parsing and machine\ntranslation, generic dynamic programming, and formal properties of\nsynchronous grammars.

In this talk, we investigate how association rules, one of\npopular \"patterns\" in the literature of data mining, can be used to help\ncompanies for decision-making in applications of inventory control and\nmarketing. More specifically, maximal-profit item selection with\ncross-selling effect (MPIS) problem is investigated. Given a set of items\nin the company, the problem is about selecting a subset of items which can\ngive the maximal profit with the consideration of cross-selling. We prove\nthat a simple version of this problem is NP-hard. We propose a new\napproach to the problem with the consideration of the loss rule - a kind\nof association rules to model the cross-selling effect. We show that the\nproblem can be transformed to a quadratic programming problem. In case\nquadratic programming is not applicable, we also propose a heuristics\napproach. Besides, we propose an evolutionary approach - genetic algorithm\n- to tackle this problem.\n\n\n***************************\nBiography:\n\nRaymond Chi-Wing Wong is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science and\nEngineering (CSE) of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\n(HKUST).

Some of the motivations are the\nneed for formal verification and the search for automated reasoning\ntechnique for XML.\n\nIn this talk we continue the study of pebble automata for words over\ninfinite alphabets introduced by F. Neven, T. Schwentick and V. Vianu [1,2].\nIn essence, pebble automata (PA) are finite state automata with a finite\nnumber of pebbles. The pebbles are placed on the input word in the stack\ndiscipline: first in last out, to mark the input symbols. One pebble can\nonly mark one symbol and the last pebble placed serves as the header. The\nautomaton moves from one state to another depending on the equality tests\namong symbols marked by the pebbles. As studied in [1,2], PA languages have\ndesirable closure properties; but undesirable in terms of application: its\nemptiness problem in general is undecidable.\n\nIn this talk we present the boundary of the subclass of PA languages of\nwhich the emptiness problem is decidable. We also establish the hierarchy of\nPA languages based on the number of pebbles. A few of our results settle\nproblems left open in [1,2]. Moreover, some of the proof techniques may be\nof general interest. For example, the proof of the undecidability of the\nemptiness problem of the so called strong 2 pebble PA is by reduction from\nHilbert's tenth problem.\n\n\nReference :\n\n[1] F. Neven, T.

But there is a\ncommon theme in these projects -- they attempt to solve some difficult\nresearch problems so that we can build a system previously considered\nimpossible.\n\nThe Extended VigilNet is a self-organizing surveillance sensor network\nthat can detect and classify four types of targets -- people, people with\nferrous objects, small vehicles, and large vehicles. The amount of data it\nprocesses in one minute exceeds what some other types of sensor networks\nmay collect in their whole lifetime of several months. Moreover, all the\nprocessing is done in the network with strictly resource constrained\ndevices.\n\nThe t-kernel is an operating system that uses pure software methods to\nefficiently implement OS protection and virtual memory. Many\nmicrocontrollers used in very-low-power embedded systems lack the hardware\nfeatures (privilege, address translation logic, etc.) traditionally\nrequired for OS protection and virtual memory. Hence, systems with these\nmicrocontrollers had to use simplistic operating systems, giving rise to\nmany difficulties in programming and system management. The t-kernel\nremoves this limitation and enables very-low-power systems to use advanced\nOS features.\n\nThe Vivaldi/8 project aims at developing a sensor network system that can\noperate for multiple years with \"continuous vigilance\", meaning that the\nsystem monitors unsynchronized external events in a \"non-stop\" manner.\nSuch a long lifetime more than doubles what the best currently known\nsystem can achieve, and will significantly enhance the functionality\nof sensor network systems.\n\n***************************\nBiography:\n\nLin Gu received B.S. from Fudan University, M.S. from Peking University,\nand Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Virginia.

After a long period\nof relative stability, both in terms of storage and also in terms of\nprocessor design, the environment has radically changed.  In terms of\nstorage, solid state drives are rapidly becoming standard storage\nsolutions, while the current multi-core processor design effectively\ndictates a shared memory design for high-performing applications.   In\nthis talk, I will (a) focus on our work on making better use of solid\nstate drives in database applications and (b) briefly present some of our\nongoing work on making better use of current processor designs.\n\nAs far as solid state drives go, we target hybrid systems that contain\nboth solid state and magnetic disk drives.  We propose that instead of\ntreating the solid state drive as a cache for the magnetic disk, we put\nthem both at the same level of the memory hierarchy.  Then, we take\nadvantage of the asymmetric properties of the solid state drive's read and\nwrite speeds and using a workload-driven approach we decide on the optimal\nplacement of each database page: pages with a read-intensive workload are\nplaced on the solid state drive, while pages with a write-intensive\nworkload are placed on the magnetic disk drive.  Our theoretical results\nand our experimental evaluation prove this to be the optimal usage in such\nhybrid systems.\n\nIn terms of supporting new processor architectures, we argue that the\nbottleneck is in fact the complexity of the database engine in terms of\nits use of the iterator model.  We propose that instead of composing\noperators for a given database query, one is better off generating custom,\nquery-specific, and processor-friendly code and then compiling and\nexecuting it.  Our results in this area show that such an approach\ndominates both the iterator-based design, and other hardware-friendly\ndesigns.\n\n\n********************\nBiography:\n\nDr Stratis D.

In wireless sensor networks,\nenergy constraint is by far the most critical hurdle hindering the\npractical deployment of this emerging technology.

To illustrate our design principle and\nmethodologies, this talk focuses on energy-synchronized computing -a\nholistic approach to synchronize sensor network activities with dynamic\nenergy supply from the environments.  Specifically, we will discuss a\nthree-layer architecture for Sustainable Sensor Networks, namely (i) the\ndesign of sustainable TwinStar nodes; (ii) the control of leakage-aware\nenergy synchronization; and (iii) the adaptation of energy-synchronized\ncommunication and sensing.\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nProf. Tian He is currently an assistant professor in the Department of\nComputer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota-Twin City.\nProf. He is the author and co-author of over 80 papers in premier sensor\nnetwork journals and conferences with collectively over 3000 citations.\nDr. He has received a number of research awards in the area of sensor\nnetworking, including four best paper awards (MSN 2006, SASN 2006, MASS\n2008,  MDM 2009).

While it is generally accepted that we have entered the\nmulticore era, concerns exist on when or will moving into the manycore\nstage. Recently, Hill and Marty presented a pessimistic view of multicore\nscalability, citing Amdahl's law and the memory-wall problem. Technology\nis available, but major vendors are hesitant in making processors that\nhave a large number of cores. This is a very interesting phenomenon, where\nhistory seems to repeat itself on the scalability debate of parallel\nprocessing that occurred 20 years ago. In this introductory keynote talk\nwe first review the history and concepts of scalable computing, and review\nthe current technologies and the memory-wall problem. We then use the same\nhardware cost model of multicore chips used by Hill and Marty to introduce\ntwo performance models from the scalable computing point of view. These\nmodels show that there is no inherent, immovable upper bound on the\nscalability of multicore architectures. Finally, we conclude with proposed\nsolutions to the memory-wall problem to make the potential scalability of\nmulticore reachable in practice.\n\n\n************************\nBiography:\n\nDr. Xian-He Sun is a professor of computer science and the director of the\nScalable Computing Software laboratory at Illinois Institute of Technology\n(IIT), and is a guest faculty in the Mathematics and Computer Science\nDivision and Computing Division at the Argonne and Fermi National\nLaboratory, respectively.

Without proper\nsynchronization, concurrent access to shared objects can lead to race\nconditions, and incorrect synchronization logic can lead to starvation or\ndeadlock. Moreover, concurrency confounds the development of reusable\nsoftware modules because synchronization policies and decisions are\ndifficult to localize into a single software module. Szumo\n(Synchronization Units Model) extends an object-oriented language with a\nnotion of synchronization contracts to address these concerns. In lieu of\nwriting low-level code to acquire and release shared objects, programmers\ndeclare synchronization contracts in a module's interface. A distributed\nrun-time scheduler negotiates the contracts on behalf of processes,\nensuring that the contracts of all modules are met while simultaneously\nguarding against data races and avoidable deadlocks.

Most existing\nmethods focus on pinpointing a single statement or function call which\nis very likely to contain bugs. Although such methods could be very\naccurate, it is usually very hard for developers to understand the context\nof the bug, given the bug locations in isolation. In this study, we\npropose to model software executions with graphs at two levels of\ngranularity: methods and basic blocks. Individual node represents a method\nor basic block and edge represents a method call, method return or\ntransition (at method or basic block granularity). Given a set of graphs\nof correct and faulty executions, we propose to extract the most dis-\ncriminative subgraphs which contrast the program \ufffdow of correct and faulty\nexecutions. The extracted subgraphs not only pinpoint the bug, but also\nprovide an informative context for understanding and fixing the bug.\nDifferent from traditional graph mining which mines a very large set of\nfrequent subgraphs, we formulate the subgraph mining as an optimization\nproblem and directly generate the most discriminative subgraph with a\nrecently proposed graph mining algorithm LEAP. We further extend it to\ngenerate a ranked list of top-k discriminative subgraphs representing\ndistinct locations which may contain bugs. Experimental results and case\nstudies show that our proposed method is both effective and efficient to\nmine discriminative subgraphs for bug localization and context\nidentification.\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nHong Cheng is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Systems\nEngineering and Engineering Management at the Chinese University of Hong\nKong.

More\nspecifically, we seek to establish delay-constrained throughput and\nthroughput-constrained delay performance estimation methods. Furthermore,\nwe formulate a numerical optimization problem to compute the maximum\nachievable throughput/delay performance under delay/throughput constraints\nin a given geographical area. Starting with an infinitely dense network,\nwe solve the optimization problem by determining node locations and\ncreating a transmission schedule.

Forcing packets\nto wait at the head of queues and coordinating packet injections among\ndifferent sources enable effective control of co-packet interference.\nUsing non-linear probabilistic hopping models, waiting times which jointly\noptimize throughput and delay performances are derived for special cases.\nOptimal coordinated injection strategies are also investigated as\nfunctions of the number of information sources and their separations.

The capacitated domination problem (CDP) with demand constraints\nis to find a capacitated dominating multi-set D of minimum cardinality.\nConsider a graph G=(V,E), in which each vertex has a demand and a\ncapacity. The capacity of a vertex specifies the maximum amount of service\nthat the vertex can deliver to meet the demands of all the vertices it\ndominates, and the demand constraint of a vertex specifies that the demand\nof the vertex can only be met by the vertices in D that dominate the\nvertex. The CDP is said to be unsplittable, if the demand of each vertex\ncan be met by exactly one vertex in D, and splittable, otherwise.\n\nIn this talk, we investigate the capacitated domination problem on trees\nand present a linear time algorithm for the unsplittable demand model, and\na pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for the splittable demand model.

Unfortunately, most of the previous studies on\nprivacy preservation can deal with relational data only, and cannot be\napplied to social network data.  We take an initiative towards preserving\nprivacy in social network data.  We identify an essential type of privacy\nattacks: neighborhood attacks.

Recombination events tend to cluster into narrow spans of a few\nthousand DNA bases, called recombination hotspots.

An open question is what regulatory signals\nare responsible for the existence of a hotspot at a particular genomic\nlocation. In this talk, I will present a novel computational approach\ntowards answering this question. Based on coalescent models of sequence\nevolution, we provide the first look at the large scale association of\nrecombination hotspots with DNA sequence polymorphism, and demonstrate the\nexistence of such association for a significant fraction of hotspots.\nImportantly, our computational method is able to correctly predict the\nassociation of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism FG11 with the hotspot\nDNA2, which has been reported by sperm typing experiments.

As has been demonstrated in the context of the human genome, the\nacquisition of data is but a preliminary step, and true challenge lies in\ndeveloping effective means to analyze such data and endow them with\nphysical or functional meaning. The wealth of data acquired through\nimaging contains invaluable spatio-temporal information on biological\nprocesses and systems. The inherent nature of bioimages leads to\nuncertainty in data, e.g., to which retinal image layer does a given pixel\nbelong, what is the thickness of a neurite, how many photoreceptors are\nthere, or what is the length of a microtubule. Probability distributions\nare the natural way to model such phenomena. The aggregation of data (such\nas the thickness of a layer measured at different spatial locations or the\nlength of all microtubules in an image) again leads to distributions. In\nthis talk, I will first introduce a few kinds of bioimage data. Then, I\nwill discuss image analysis and feature extraction techniques that produce\nprobabilistic data.

Studies show that code duplication\ncan incur higher maintenance costs and lead to subtle errors. Identifying\nsimilar code thus has many important applications, such as program\nunderstanding, refactoring, optimization, and bug detection. In this talk,\nI will present three pieces of my work on techniques and applications of\nscalable detection of both syntactic and semantic code clones.\n\nFirst, I will present Deckard, a scalable and accurate tree-based code\nclone detection technique. The key insight is to represent syntax trees of\na program as structure-preserving characteristic vectors in the Euclidean\nspace and employ efficient hashing algorithms to cluster these vectors.\nOur experiments showed that Deckard scales to billions of lines of code\nwith few false positives. Also, Deckard is language-generic, applicable to\nany language with a formally specified grammar.\n\nSecond, we will look at a novel application of Deckard to bug detection.\nIn particular, I will describe a general notion of context-based\ninconsistencies as strong indicators of clone-related bugs and the\napplication of Deckard to identify such inconsistencies. Many previously\nunknown bugs in large projects such as the Linux\nkernel and Eclipse were discovered. These bugs exhibit diverse\ncharacteristics and are difficult to detect with any single previous bug\ndetection technique.\n\nThird, I will describe EqMiner, the first scalable technique to detect\nfunctionally equivalent code for understanding code duplication at the\nsemantic level. Inspired by Schwartz's randomized polynomial identity\ntesting, EqMiner uses automated random testing to quickly determine the\nfunctional equivalence of arbitrary code fragments automatically extracted\nfrom a large program. Evaluated on the Linux kernel, EqMiner discovered\nmany functionally equivalent code fragments that are syntactically\ndifferent.\n\nI will conclude this talk by discussing future opportunities and\nchallenges related to code clone detection.\n\n\n********************\nBiography:\n\nLingxiao Jiang is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at University of\nCalifornia, Davis, where he specializes in software engineering.

One problem is that in general, we won't know what\nthose strategies are; instead, we'll only have observations of the agents'\ninteractions with other agents. In this talk, I describe how to take a set\nof interaction traces produced by different pairs of players in a\ntwo-player repeated game, and then find the best way to combine them into\na composite strategy. I also describe how to incorporate the composite\nstrategy into an existing agent, as an enhancement of the agent's original\nstrategy. In cross-validated experiments involving 126 agents (most of\nwhich written by students as class projects) for the Iterated Prisoner's\nDilemma, Iterated Chicken Game, and Iterated Battle of the Sexes,\ncomposite strategies produced from these agents were able to make\nimprovement to the performance of nearly all of the agents.\n\nI will also talk about a technique, Symbolic Noise Detection (SND), for\ndetecting noise (i.e., mistakes or miscommunications) among agents in\nrepeated games. The idea behind SND is that if we can build a model of the\nother agent's behavior, we can use this model to detect and correct\nactions that have been affected by noise. In the 20th Anniversary Iterated\nPrisoner's Dilemma competition, the SND agent placed third in the \"noise\"\ncategory, and was the best performer among programs that had no \"slave\"\nprograms feeding points to them.\n\n\n*************************\nBiography:\n\nTsz-Chiu Au is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas at Austin.\nHe graduated with a Ph.D. degree in the Department of Computer Science at\nthe University of Maryland, College Park in 2008.

In the talk, first, University of Karlsruhe (TH) and\ninterACT research center will be introduced briefly.  Afterwards,\ndeveloped computer vision systems will be presented. The rest of the talk\nwill be focused on robust face recognition.\n\nFace recognition has attracted significant amount of research efforts\nduring the last two decades.  A plethora of appearance-based face\nrecognition algorithms have dominated the literature. Nevertheless, these\napproaches are not able to handle the variations that can occur on facial\nappearance due to changing illumination, occlusion, aging, etc. Only a\nsubset of these approaches, which have been specifically developed to\ncombat against one of these variations, can handle the facial appearance\nvariations that they are developed for.  However, for reliable real-world\noperation, a face recognition algorithm has to handle all the variations\nthat it can confront with. In the robust face recognition part of the\ntalk, this problem will be addressed and a generic face recognition\nalgorithm that performs robustly against the variations in facial\nappearance will be described. In addition, several face recognition\nsystems that have been developed based on this algorithm will be\npresented.\n\n\n***************\nBiography:\n\nHazim K.

Our approach is based on the observation\nthat the intrinsic symmetries of a shape are transformed into the Euclidean\nsymmetries in the signature space defined by the eigenfunctions of the\nLaplace-Beltrami operator. We devise an algorithm which detects and computes the\nisometric mappings from the shape onto itself. Our algorithm is both\ncomputationally efficient and robust with respect to small non-isometric\ndeformations, even if they include topological changes.\n\nThe aforementioned method works very well when the whole object is intrinsically\nsymmetric. However, in practice objects are often partially symmetric. To tackle\nthis problem, we have developed an algorithm that detects partial intrinsic\nsimilarities of shapes. Our method models the heat flow on the object and uses\nthe heat distribution as signature to characterize points and regions on the\nshape. Using the multiscale nature of the heat distribution,\nwe are able to quantify the similarity between points at certain scale, and\ndetermine, in particular, at which scale the point or region becomes unique.\nThis method can be used in data analysis, visualization and compression.\n\n\n***********************\nBiography:\n\nDr. Jian SUN is a postdoctoral schoIar in Department of Computer Science\nat Stanford University, working with Prof. Leonidas J.

To\nmeet these challenges, ad hoc networking solutions should incorporate\ndistributed intelligence that enables network nodes to autonomously adapt\nto changes in networking environments and network configurations. By\npropagating software codes to mobile nodes for executing and allowing them\nto spawn new codes for propagation to other nodes, mobile agents can\nprovide an effective solutions for these challenges. This presentation\nprovides an overview of the use of mobile agents in ad hoc networks,\nespecially in their practical realization for wireless personal\ncommunications and wireless sensor networking. In the first example, we\ndescribe the Bluescout mobile agents for scatternet formation in Bluetooth\nnetworks, which adaptively reconfigures the Bluetooth scatternet to\nmaximize the size of individual piconets. In the second example, we\npresent the design of a mobile agent platform for wireless sensor networks\nknown as Wiseman, and describe a limited experimental implementation of\nWiseman and its evaluation.

Annotating ncRNAs in gnome databases for biological\nfunction analysis is thus becoming increasingly important. The most widely\nused tool for describing ncRNA families is based on the stochastic\ncontext-free grammar (SCFG). However, the use of SCFG incurs a high\ncomputational cost, which creates a major challenge for searching ncRNAs\nin large-scale gnome databases.\n\nA promising approach to speed up SCFG based ncRNA search is to use filters\nto exclude a large portion of the database that is unlikely to contain the\nncRNA of interest. In this talk, I will present a systematic framework to\nutilize a new filter called the secondary structure profile (SSP) that can\nbe efficiently scanned against large databases. We use dynamic programming\nto estimate an SSP's sensitivity and false positive rate, which leads to\nan efficient and fully automated filter design algorithm. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our SSP-based filters can achieve high sensitivity,\nspecificity, and an average of 200x speedup for a majority of known ncRNA\nfamilies.\n\n\n******************\nBiography:\n\nYanni SUN is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and\nEngineering at Washington University in St. Louis, USA.

On the other hand, the radio resources in\nwireless system, like spectrum, power and time slots are still expensive,\nand the network operators always want to operate the system at the best\nresource efficiency possible.  In this work, we utilizes the video\nsummarization technique to achieve VLBR video traffic shaping, and\nformulate the multi-access video-on-demand problem as a resource\nconstrained total utility maximization problem. A dual-decomposition based\nresource pricing solution is found as the outer loop of control, that\ncouples with local adaptation at mobiles, to achieve high radio resource\nefficiency and best QoS possible. Simulation results demonstrated the\neffectiveness of this approach, and some extensions of the framework\nproposed.\n\n\n********************\nBiography:\n\nZhu Li received his PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering from\nNorthwestern University, Evanston in 2004.

We survey the operation and the\ninfrastructure that supports the IPTV: the data center, the Internet, and\nthe end user, and discuss issues that affect the global scalability of\nIPTV. We show that the client-server model cannot support large scale IPTV\ndelivery, and the peer assisted IPTV service without locality awareness\nwill quickly overrun the Internet backbone when the number of subscribers\nincreases. Peer-assisted delivery with locality is the only way to scale\nIPTV to the world.\n\nWe proceed to quantify the benefit of peer-assisted IPTV. Using a\nnine-month trace from a client-server IPTV deployment for MSN Video, we\nshow that peer-assistance IPTV can dramatically reduce server bandwidth\ncosts, particularly if peers prefetch content when there is spare upload\ncapacity in the system.

We examine aggregation in a multi-core\nenvironment, the Sun UltraSPARC T1, a chip multiprocessor with eight cores\nand a shared L2 cache. Aggregation is an important aspect of query\nprocessing that is seemingly easy to understand and implement. Our\nresearch, however, demonstrates that a chip multiprocessor adds new\ndimensions to understanding hash-based aggregation performance: concurrent\nsharing of aggregation data structures and contentious accesses to\nfrequently used values. We also identify a trade off between private data\nstructures assigned to each thread versus shared data structures for\naggregation.  Depending on input characteristics, different aggregation\nstrategies are optimal and choosing the wrong strategy can result in a\nperformance penalty of over an order of magnitude. We provide a thorough\nexplanation of the factors affecting aggregation performance on chip\nmultiprocessors and identify three key input characteristics that dictate\nperformance: (1) average run length of identical group-by values, (2)\nlocality of references to the aggregation hash table, and (3) frequency of\nrepeated accesses to the same hash table location. We then introduce an\nadaptive aggregation operator that performs lightweight sampling of the\ninput to choose the correct aggregation strategy with high accuracy.  Our\nexperiments verify that our adaptive algorithm chooses the highest\nperforming aggregation strategy on a number of common input distributions.\n\nThis is joint work with John Cieslewicz.\n\n*****************\nBiography:\n\nKenneth ROSS is a Professor in the Computer Science Department at Columbia\nUniversity in New York City.

In light of access to such data-sets,\nscientists and system analysts are no longer restricted to modeling and\nsimulation when analyzing real-world events. Instead, the preferred viable\napproach derives observations and verifies hypotheses by analytical\nexploration of representative real datasets that capture the corresponding\nevent. This approach demands intelligent data storage, access, and\nanalytical querying solutions and tools that facilitate convenient,\nefficient, and effective exploration of these massive datasets.\n\nWavelet Transform has emerged as an elegant tool for online analytical\nqueries. Most of the methods using wavelets, however, share the\ndisadvantage of providing only data-dependant approximate answers by\ncompressing the data. On the contrary, we developed an end-to-end system,\ntermed ProDA (for Progressive Data Analysis) that does not rely on\ncompressing the data. Instead, ProDA employs wavelet transformation to\ncompact incoming queries rather than the underlying data. The intuition\nhere is that queries are well-formed with repetitive patterns that can be\nexploited by wavelets for a more effective compression, leading to\nefficient query performance.  ProDA employs wavelets to support exact,\napproximate, and progressive OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) queries\non large multidimensional datasets, while keeping update costs relatively\nlow. ProDA not only supports online execution of ad hoc analytical queries\non massive datasets, but also extends the set of supported analytical\nqueries to include the entire family of polynomial aggregate queries as\nwell as the new class of group-by queries.  We have verified the\neffectiveness of ProDA in practice by conducting extensive sets of\nexperiments with several real-world datasets from NASA and Chevron.\n\nThe details of PRODA project can be found in:\nhttp://infolab.usc.edu/News/PDF_FINAL_PRODA.pdf\n\n\n*****************\nBiography:\n\nCyrus SHAHABI is currently an Associate Professor and the Director of the\nInformation Laboratory (InfoLAB) at the Computer Science Department and\nalso a Research Area Director at the NSF's Integrated Media Systems Center\n(IMSC) at the University of Southern California.

Developed\nbased on the standard $\\ell_1$-norm inverse solvers, this sparse\ndistributed inverse solver integrates the $\\ell_1$-norm spatial model with\na temporal model of the source signals in order to avoid unstable\nactivation patterns and \"spiky\" reconstructed signals often produced by\nthe currently used sparse solvers. The joint spatio-temporal model leads\nto a cost function with an $\\ell_1$$\\ell_2$-norm regularizer whose\nminimization can be reduced to a convex second-order cone programming\n(SOCP) problem and efficiently solved using the interior-point method. The\nefficient computation of the SOCP problem allows us to implement\npermutation tests for estimating statistical significance of the inverse\nsolution. Validation with simulated and real MEG data shows that the\nproposed solver yields source time course estimates qualitatively similar\nto those obtained through dipole fitting, but without the need to specify\nthe number of dipole sources in advance. Furthermore, the\n$\\ell_1$$\\ell_2$-norm solver achieves fewer false positives and a better\nrepresentation of the source locations than the conventional $\\ell_2$\nminimum-norm estimates.\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nDetails are available at http://people.csail.mit.edu/wanmei/\n", "type": "Seminar", "name": ["A Distributed Spatio-Temporal EEG/MEG Inverse Solver"], "lenArticle": 236},

On the one hand, Computer Science provides the tools for\nperforming optimization and efficiently solving these problems under time\nand space constraints.

Mechanism\ndesign is the study of protocols for selfish agents.  It focuses on the\nquestion of how to elicit information from such agents to perform\noptimization.  In the past, most work in mechanism design has focused on\nstatic one-shot settings.

Although VANET is a kind of\nmobile ad hoc network, many unique characteristics of VANET bring out new\nresearch challenges. For example, due to fast vehicle movement, the link\ntopology changes rapidly. As a result, many well studied structures for\nefficient data dissemination such as tree, cluster and grid, are extremely\nhard to be set up and maintained. Also, the network density is highly\ndynamic. The traffic density is low in rural areas and during night, which\nmay result in frequent disconnections and network partitions. Thus, data\ndissemination techniques should address these unique characteristics of\nVANET. In this talk, I will present our solutions for data dissemination\nin VANETs. For infrastructureless data dissemination, we design and\nevaluate vehicle-assisted data delivery protocols for sparsely connected\nVANET. Different from existing works, we make use of the predictable\nmobility in VANET, which is limited by the traffic pattern and the road\nlayout. For infrastructure-assisted data dissemination, we design and\nevaluate service scheduling protocols, and protocols to efficiently\nutilization the bandwidth. We also propose a data pouring scheme to push\ndata to the users to reduce the query delay.\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nGuohong CAO received his BS degree from Xian Jiaotong University, Xian,\nChina.

Thus, kernels not only transform data sets such that good\ngeneralization can be achieved using only linear discriminant functions,\nbut this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economic\nuse of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide\nefficient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning\nproblems.

Our\nalgorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data\nset and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to aid in model selection, and\nto (3) denoise in feature space in order to yield better classification\nresults.\n\nWe complement our theoretical findings by reporting on applications of our\nmethod to data from gene finding and brain computer interfacing.\n\nThis is joint work with Claudia Sanelli, Mikio Braun and Joachim M.\nBuhmann.\n\n******************\nBiography:\n\nKlaus-Robert Muller received the Diploma degree in mathematical physics in\n1989 and the Ph.D. in theoretical computer science in 1992, both from\nUniversity of Karlsruhe, Germany.

Due to limited communication bandwidth and other resource\nconstraints, a critical and practical demand is to online compress data\nstreams continuously with quality guarantee. Although many data\ncompression and digital signal processing methods have been developed to\nreduce data volume, their super-linear time and more-than-constant space\ncomplexity prevents them from being applied directly on data streams,\nparticularly over resource-constrained wireless networks, e.g., wireless\nsensor networks, or low-speed, low-power wireless personal area networks\n(WPAN). We tackle the problem of online quality guaranteed compression of\ndata streams using fast linear approximation (i.e., using line segments to\napproximate a time series). Technically, we address two versions of the\nproblem which explore quality guarantees in different forms. We develop\nonline algorithms with linear time complexity and constant cost in space.\nOur algorithms are optimal in the sense they generate the minimum number\nof segments that approximate a time series with the required quality\nguarantee, even without knowing future in-coming data. To meet the\nresource constraints, we also develop a fast algorithm which creates\nconnecting segments with very simple computation. The low cost nature of\nour methods leads to a unique edge on the applications of massive and fast\nstreaming environment, low bandwidth networks, and heavily constrained\nnodes in computational power. We implement and evaluate our methods in the\napplication of an acoustic wireless sensor network.\n\n\n***********************\nBiography:\n\nKui Wu received BSc. and Master's degrees from Wuhan University, China and\nthe Ph.D degree from the University of Alberta, Canada.

Due to\nenvironmental limitations, such transactions usually cannot be made to\nconform to standard ACID semantics. We propose set consistency, a\npowerful, yet intuitive, notion of consistency for long-running\ntransactions. Set consistency considers the collection of permanent\n(non-intermittent) changes made by a process, when viewed at the end of\nits execution. Consistency requirements for such collections of changes\nare specified as predicates over the atomic actions of a process. Set\nconsistency generalizes self-cancellation, a standard consistency\nrequirement for long-running transactions, where failed processes are\nresponsible for undoing any partially completed work. Set consistency can\nalso express strictly stronger requirements, such as mutual exclusion or\ndependency. In this talk, I will describe the ideas behind set\nconsistency, our theoretical results on set consistency verification, the\nimplementation of our verifier tool, and in-progress work.

Important examples are the Internet\nArchive, which has collected multiple snapshots of the web since 1995,\nWikipedia, which keeps track of all versions of each article, or\nversioning file systems and revision control systems. Since the sizes of\nsuch archival collections are often much larger than the latest snapshot,\nthis presents us with significant performance challenges. Current search\nengines use many techniques for index compression and optimized query\nexecution, but these techniques do not exploit the significant\nsimilarities between different versions of a document, or between related\ndocuments.\n\nIn this talk, we discuss challenges and research issues in searching and\nmining archival text collections. We then propose a framework for indexing\nand query processing in archival collections and, more generally, any\ncollections with a sufficient amount of similarity between documents or\nversions. This approach results in significant reductions in index size\nand query processing costs on such collections, and it is orthogonal to\nand can be combined with existing techniques. It also supports highly\nefficient updates, both locally and over a network.

First, the bug cache contains 10% of the files\nin a software project. Through an analysis of the software's development\nhistory and the location of bugs, files are added and removed from the\ncache based on four bug localities: temporal, spatial, changed-entity, and\nnew-entity locality.

To address this problem, I will present three techniques for\nturning an existing, powerful, but false-positive-ridden, static analysis\ninto a precise tool for automatic bug-finding.\n\nFirst, we will automatically convert the output of a static analysis to\nconcrete JUnit test cases, using constraint solving techniques. We thereby\neliminate language-level false bug warnings and make the results easier to\nunderstand for human consumers. We will then add a dynamic invariant\ninference step to also address the harder problem of bug warnings that are\ntechnically correct but still irrelevant to the user (these bugs could\noccur, but only under obscure conditions). Finally, we will adapt dynamic\ninvariant inference to work correctly with subtyping. Previous approaches\ndo not take behavioral subtyping into account and therefore produce\nimprecise or inconsistent results, which can throw off automated analyses\nsuch as the ones we are performing for bug-finding.\n\nI have implemented these techniques in the JCrasher, Check 'n' Crash, and\nDSD-Crasher automatic testing tools, which have been used by multiple\nresearch groups.\n\n\n***********************\nBiography:\n\nChristoph Csallner is currently a Ph.D. candidate at Georgia Tech, advised\nby Professor Yannis Smaragdakis.

For example, in customer-centric applications,\nunderstanding customer behavior can help companies to improve their\nservices and thus enhance their competitive position in the market. Most\nresearch works about data mining focus on finding different \"patterns\"\nwhich can help the process of decision-making. However, it is generally\ntrue that the patterns in themselves do not serve the end purpose of the\nbusiness people. We believe that the patterns can aid in more specific\ntargets. In this talk, we investigate how association rules, one of\npopular patterns in the literature of data mining, can be used to help\ncompanies for decision-making in applications of inventory control and\nmarketing. More specifically, maximal-profit item selection with\ncross-selling effect (MPIS) problem is investigated. Given a set of items\nin the company, the problem is about selecting a subset of items which can\ngive the maximal profit with the consideration of cross-selling. We prove\nthat a simple version of this problem is NP-hard. We propose a new\napproach to the problem with the consideration of the loss rule - a kind\nof association rules to model the cross-selling effect. We show that the\nproblem can be transformed to a quadratic programming problem. In case\nquadratic programming is not applicable, we also propose a heuristics\napproach. Besides, we propose an evolutionary approach - genetic algorithm\n- to tackle this problem.\n\n************************\nBiography:\n\nRaymond Chi-Wing WONG received the BSc and MPhil degrees in computer\nscience and engineering in the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2002 and\n2004, respectively.

A lot of classification methods have been\nproposed in literature, most of which assume that the input data is in a\nfeature vector representation.  However, in many applications, it is\ndesirable to construct accurate classification models on complex\nstructural data which has no initial feature vector representation,\nincluding transactions, sequences, graphs, semi-structured data, and\ntexts.  A primary question is how to construct a discriminative and\ncompact feature set, on the basis of which, classification could be\nperformed directly.  A concrete example is classifying chemical compounds\nto various classes (e.g., toxic vs. nontoxic, active vs. inactive).  While\nsimple features such as atoms and links are too simple to preserve the\nstructural information, graph kernels make it hard to interpret the\nclassifiers.\n\nMy goal is to use discriminative frequent patterns to characterize complex\nstructural data and thus enhance the classification power.  Theoretical\nanalysis is provided to justify the discriminative power of frequent\npatterns.  Two efficient search strategies have also been designed to\ndirectly mine the most discriminative patterns.  Based on these results, I\ndeveloped a framework of discriminative frequent pattern-based\nclassification which could lead to a highly accurate, efficient and\ninterpretable classifier on complex data.  The proposed pattern-based\nclassification has been demonstrated useful in applications such as\nchemical compound classification, text categorization as well as software\nengineering.\n\n\n********************\nBiography:\n\nHong CHENG is currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer\nScience, at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

This talk is about an\ninvestigation that was triggered by our accidental discovery of a pattern\nof throughput distributions among links in IEEE 802.11 networks from\nexperiments. This pattern gives rise to an easy throughput computation\nmethod accessible even to primary-school kids, which we term\nback-of-the-envelop (BoE) computation. For modest-size networks, very\naccurate results (close-to-perfect match with NS2 simulation results) can\nbe obtained within minutes, if not seconds. While the computation\nprocedure of BoE is simple, explaining why it works is by no means\ntrivial.  In this talk, I will show how BoE can be explained theoretically\nby an ideal CSMA-network model. In developing the theory, we discovered a\nnumber of analytical techniques and observations that have eluded prior\nresearch, such as that the carrier-sensing interactions among links in an\nideal CSMA network result in a system-state evolution that is\ntime-reversible; and that the system-state probability distribution is\ninsensitive to the distributions of countdown and transmission times given\ntheir means, and is a Markov random field. We believe the ideal CSMA\nnetwork model is useful not just for explaining BoE, but also provides a\nquantitative foundation for tackling other problems in CSMA networking\n(e.g., resource allocation).  This talk will also present the relationship\nbetween the mathematics of CSMA networks and statistical physics.\n\n\n******************\nBiography:\n\nProf. Soung LIEW received his undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees from MIT.\nFrom March 1988 to July 1993, Soung worked at Bellcore (now Telcordia),\nNew Jersey.

The basic trade-off is that when more time is\nallotted for an operation, the operation can be performed using less\nenergy. Such energy/time trade-offs occur in circuit design, logic design\nand micro-architectural trade-offs.  With the central role of power\nconsumption in limiting computer performance, we have been surprised, even\nshocked, that the computer science theory community has apparently\nneglected the opportunity for energy/time trade-offs in the design of\nalgorithms. In this talk, I will present a model for algorithm design and\nanalysis that incorporates these trade-offs. In this model, we assume that\nunlimited parallelism is available, but that communication has a cost that\ngrows with distance.  Energy and time can be traded with $ET^\\alpha$ being\na constant for some $\\alpha > 0$. I will give a brief, physical\njustification for the model and then apply it to sorting, addition and\nmultiplication. In each case, I will present a lower-bound for the cost of\nthe task and present an algorithm that achieves this bound to within\nconstant factors. I will conclude the talk by describing areas for further\nresearch including analyzing a wider range of algorithms, refining the\nmodel to include more physical constraints and possible applications of\nthis approach to understanding issues in computer architecture.\n\nThis is joint work with Brad Bingham, a graduate student at UBC.\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nMark GREENSTREET received the B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Caltech\nin 1981 and the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science in 1988 and\n1993 respectively from Princeton University.

Typically, it is assumed that the data are\nrelatively static, with database updates occurring less frequently than\nqueries.

Much of our understanding and appreciation\nof the world is based on the perception and recognition of shared or\nrepeated patterns, and so is our sense of beauty and style. Recognition\nand categorization of symmetry and symmetry groups is the first step\ntowards capturing the essential skeleton of a problem, while at the same\ntime minimizing computational redundancy. Our research in the realm of\n\"Computational Symmetry\" explores the use of symmetry and symmetry groups\nin a wide range of applications in computer vision, computer graphics,\nrobotics and medical image analysis, including texture analysis, synthesis\nand manipulation, human gait recognition, human identification, expression\nclassification, robotics assembly planning, computer aided diagnosis of\ndegenerative neurological disorders from structural MR images, and\nquantification of the firing fields of grid cells in rat brains. The\ncentral theme of this talk exposes a rapidly emerging research area, and\nthe promise and perils of making the idea of symmetry and group theory\ncomputationally feasible for real world problems.\n\n\n***********************\nBiography:\n\nYanxi LIU received her B.S. degree in physics/electrical engineering in\nBeijing and her Ph.D. degree in computer science for group theory\napplications in robotics from University of Massachusetts.

This problem is crucial to many applications (that\nutilize parallel communication or processing paths) like multi-path\nwireless channels, multi-path routing, data processing by network\nprocessors, and trans-coding multimedia flow traffic content over the\nInternet, to name a few. The aim of our research is to design packet\nscheduling algorithms for multilink systems that reduce packet reordering,\nand ensure fair sharing of flows and result in optimal utilization of the\nlinks.\n\nIn this talk, we first propose a Dynamic Batch Co-Scheduling (DBCS) scheme\nto schedule packets in a heterogeneous multilink system assuming that the\nworkload is perfectly divisible. The processed loads from the processors\nare ordered perfectly. We analyze the throughput and derive expressions\nfor the batch size, scheduling time and maximum number of schedulable\nprocessors. To effectively schedule variable length packets, we propose a\nPacketized Dynamic Batch Co-Scheduling (P-DBCS) scheme by applying a\ncombination of deficit round robin (DRR) and surplus round robin (SRR)\nschemes. We extend the algorithm to handle multiple flows based on a fair\nscheduling of flows depending on their reservations.

This work has particular applications in the field of\nmultimedia search engines and music/ audio classification.\n\nThe interval between two successive beats in a musical sequence is called\nthe inter-onset interval (IOI), a parameter of considerable significance\nin many tempo estimation algorithms. In order to investigate IOI\ncharacteristics we created a data set of 50 musical recordings extracted\nfrom audio CDs. Two musicians were then studied while they reproduced the\nbeat sequence of the music recordings. The resulting observations of IOI\nwere then incorporated into our tempo extraction system. Our tempo\nextraction system operates by first applying a discrete wavelet transform\n(DWT) to the audio file. The input signal is then decomposed into four\nlevels of DWT coefficients and a peak detection algorithm is applied to\nextract all peaks from these DWT coefficients, incorporating the\nobservations concerning IOI made previously. All peaks are used to\ncalculate the IOI, with appropriate weighting. All the weighted IOIs form\na histogram. The histogram is then smoothed out using a Gaussian function.\nAudio input which is in stereo format is treated as three different\ninputs; the left channel, the right channel and the mono channel. We pass\nthese three inputs into our system and automatically select the best one\nto be our final tempo result.\n\nWe tested our system using our data set of 50 musical recordings and data\nused in a tempo extraction contest during the International Conference on\nMusic Information Retrieval (ISMIR 2004). We obtained the correct tempo\nfor 47 out of the 50 songs in our data set, achieving high accuracy. For\nthe contest our ranking for one musical data set was 2nd out of 12 and for\nthe other it was 3rd out of 12. This result shows that our system is\ncompetitive with others used in the contest.\n\nThis is joint work with Mr. TSANG, Raymond Kei-Man.\n\n\n************************\nBiography:\n\nDr David Rossiter is a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of\nComputer Science and Engineering at HKUST.

The approach provides a\npractical method for learning high-order Markov Random Field (MRF) models\nwith potential functions that extend over large pixel neighborhoods. These\nhigh-order models significantly increase the expressive power of MRFs. The\nkey insight involves modeling the MRF potentials using a\nProducts-of-Experts framework that exploits non-linear functions of many\nlinear filter responses. In contrast to previous MRF approaches all\nparameters, including the linear filters themselves, are learned from\ntraining data. We demonstrate the capabilities of this Field of Experts\n(FoE) model with two example applications in archival film restoration:\nimage denoising and image inpainting. Film grain noise in archival films\nis particularly challenging because it varies with image intensity, is\nnon-Gaussian, and is spatially correlated. While the FoE model is trained\non a generic image database, and is not tuned toward a specific\napplication, we obtain results that compete with and even outperform\nspecialized techniques.

If the preference order satisfies appropriate postulates,\nthen the decision maker can be viewed as acting as if he has a probability\non states and a utility function on outcomes, and is maximizing expected\nutility.  This framework implicitly assumes that the decision maker knows\nwhat the states and outcomes are.  That isn't reasonable in a complex\nsituation.  For example, in trying to decide whether or not to attack\nIraq, what are the states and what are the outcomes?  We redo Savage\nviewing acts essentially as syntactic programs.  We don't need to assume\neither states or outcomes.   However, among other things, we can get\nrepresentation theorems in the spirit of Savage's theorems; for Savage,\nthe agent's probability and utility are subjective; for us, in addition to\nthe probability and utility being subjective, so is the state space and\nthe outcome space.  I discuss the benefits, both conceptual and pragmatic,\nof this approach.

A emulator for RFID deployment strategy\ndesign, view, test and evaluation is helpful in walking customers\nthrough their problems. We design and implement a visual simulation\nplatform in order to improve the deployment efficiency for a RFID\napplication. The proposed emulator involves four activities: 1) modeling\nthe virtual devices: tags, readers and sensors; 2) simulating the \"key\nevents\" of a RFID system with two levels: reader events and business\nevents; 3) design the deployment strategy of a RFID system by\nsimulations; 4) evaluating the strategy and optimizing it by\nintroducing test data to improve the models.

In this talk, I will address this problem of efficiency\nin systems based on synchronous grammars and tree transducers. In\nthis model, the theoretical complexity of decoding is exponential in\nthe size of individual grammar rules due to arbitrary re-orderings\nbetween the two languages. To alleviate this problem, we develop a\ntheory of binarization for synchronous grammars which factors big\nrules into smaller, binary rules, that permit efficient decoding and\nare in fact equivalent to Inversion Transduction Grammars (ITG). We\nalso present a linear-time algorithm for synchronous binarization. In\nour large-scale experiments, we found that the syntactic re-orderings\nbetween Chinese and English are almost always binarizable and the\nresulting rule set significantly improves the speed and accuracy of\nISI's syntax-based MT system, which is currently the state-of-the-art.\n\nBesides efficiency, this novel technique of binarization also\nprovides a tool to study the formal and empirical properties of\nsynchronous grammars. For example, we are now able to address the\nfamous question by Dekai Wu that whether there are non-ITG re-\norderings between fixed-word-order languages such as English and\nChinese. Our empirical results on hand-aligned English-Chinese\nparallel text confirmed that the pro-ITG conjecture is largely\ncorrect (99.7% cases are binarizable), while we also provide, for the\nfirst-time, \"real-examples\" of non-binarizable reordering verified by\nnative speakers. If time permitting, I would also present results on\nfreer-word-order languages.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Hao Zhang, Liang Huang, Daniel Gildea, and Kevin Knight (2006).\n  Synchronous Binarization for Machine Translation.

However, classification based on LDA can perform poorly\nin applications because LDA has the small sample size (SSS) problem, which\nis closely relevant to the overfitting problem. The problem arises when\nthere are too few training measurements. To address the SSS problem in\nLDA, a general tensor discriminant analysis (GTDA) is developed. GTDA, a\nmultilinear extension of a modified LDA, makes better use of the structure\ninformation of the objects in computer vision research. It involves the\nestimation of a series of projection matrices to project an object in the\nform of a tensor from a high dimensional feature space to a low\ndimensional feature space. Comparing with two dimensional LDA, the\nsignificance of GTDA is its training stage converges as shown by\nmathematical proof.

They are however among the most difficult features to\nachieve: Modeling garments is currently very tedious using standard\nsoftware (the user has to specify 2D patterns, to position and assemble\nthem in 3D around the character body, and then run a costly\nphysically-based simulation, even if only a rest shape is needed). Hair\nstyling either use user-intensive, purely geometric approaches or combine\ngeometric features - such as drawing wavy or curly hair strands - with\nsome simplified physically-based model. This talk presents some recent\nadvances on both problems.\n\nWe first introduce a system that models realistic worn garments (i.e.\nlocally developable surfaces, with the adequate folds and wrinkles caused\nby wrapping around the human body) from a single contour sketched by the\nuser above a mannequin model. We validate the results by comparing the\ngenerated virtual garement with real replica sewn from the 2D patterns we\noutput.\n\nThe second part of the talk covers hair modeling: we introduce a new\nLagangian, reduced coordinates model called \"Super-Helices\", which is used\nto accurately discretize Cosserat's continuous model for elastic rods. We\nshow that a static implementation of this model enables to predict very\nrealistic styles for hair from arbitrary ethnical groups, and present the\nextension of the method to dynamic hair simulation.\n\n\n******************\nBiography:\n\nMarie-Paule Cani is a Professor of Computer Science at the Institut\nNational Polytechnique de Grenoble (INPG), France.

Recent research in mobile wireless image and video\ntransmission has responded to some of these demands. However, many\nchallenges remain. This talk will present some recent advances and\nchallenges in mobile wireless image and video communications. In\nparticular, two major areas of research will be discussed: (1) image and\nvideo over MIMO (multi-input multi-output) systems, and (2) distributed\nsource coding for image and video transmission. In the case of image and\nvideo over MIMO systems, major challenges, design strategies, and optimal\ntrade-off in transceiver and system design will be presented. In the case\nof distributed source coding for image and video transmission, two main\napplications are considered: (1) distributed systems where information\ncaptured by individual sensing device needs to be conveyed to a central\nnode, and (2) standard centralized image and video coding system that is\ncapable of shifting the complexity at the encoder to decoder for mobile\ndevice information gathering. One common challenge for both applications\nis to explore an effective representation of the correlated sources for\nthe encoding and decoding of the image and video sources.

Although\nnaive selfish strategies based on dropping data packets are readily\ndetected, more sophisticated strategies that manipulate ad hoc routing\nprotocols present a greater challenge. In this work we develop a method to\ndistinguish selfish peers from cooperative ones based solely on local\nobservations of AODV routing protocol behavior. Our approach uses a finite\nstate machine model of locally observed AODV actions to build a\nstatistical description of the behavior of each neighbor. We then use\nstandard statistical tests and clustering techniques to separate neighbors\ninto behavior classes, which are then classified as either selfish or\ncooperative. We use these ideas to develop an on-line detection algorithm\nsuitable for low mobility environments. Through simulations, we evaluate\nour algorithm against an adversary who attempts to operate as selfishly as\npossible while still evading detection. Under reasonable assumptions about\nthe punishment regime used in conjunction with our, our algorithm forces\nsuch an adversary to limit its selfish behavior to a level that is\nstatistically indistinguishable from cooperative behavior.\n\n\n\n******************\nBiograhpy:\n\nJonathan Shapiro is an assistant professor of Computer Science and\nEngineering at Michigan State University.

With the proliferation of wireless-enabled devices, and\nespecially multi-radio/multi-band enabled devices, much attention has been\npaid to the desire of ensuring 'always best connected' networking. There\nare several key challenges. Due to the shared nature of wireless media,\ncontention from neighboring devices causes interference, which in turn\nresults in significant system performance degradation. To eliminate\ninterference between different wireless technologies, current spectrum\nallocation policies allocate a fixed spectrum slice to each wireless\ntechnology or service, which results in poor radio resource utilization.\nMeanwhile, controls in different layers of wireless networks, such as\naccess model selection, power adjustment, channel/spectrum assignment,\nrate adaptation, scheduling, routing selection, etc. have mutual impact,\nwhich makes radio resource management an extremely tough issue. While it\nshows promise, research and development of open spectrum and multi-radio\nnetworking is one of the hottest subjects in this field and is still in\nits infancy.\n\nThrough studying the unique characteristics of multi-radio wireless\nnetworks, collaborative and cognitive networking (CCN) is proposed to make\nthe devices cognitive to the environment and adapt to the best performance\nby device collaboration. After introducing the scope of CCN, I will\npresent two concrete technologies, i.e., SoftMAC and JCAR.  To address the\nVoIP delivery over wireless mesh networks, Layer 2.5 SoftMAC that resides\nbetween the 802.11 MAC layer and IP layer is proposed to coordinate the\nreal-time and best-effort packet transmission among neighboring nodes in a\nwireless mesh network. Distributed admission control, rate control, and\nnon-preemptive priority queuing is introduced to regulate the contention\nin the mesh networks. Multiple orthogonal channels available in the\nwireless networks provide the feasibility for interference mitigation\namong nearby access. With many mobile devices being equipped with more\nthan one radio, especially the heterogeneous ones, these devices will\nconstruct a Multi-radio Multi-channel Multi-hop Wireless Network (M3WN).\nTo effectively mitigate interference in M3WN, propose a novel software\nsolution, called Layer 2.5 JCAR (joint channel assignment and routing),\nwhich resides between the MAC layer and routing layer. JCAR jointly\ncoordinates the channel selection on each wireless interface and route\nselection among interfaces based on the traffic information measured and\nexchanged among two-hop neighbor nodes.\n\n\n************************\nBiography:\n\nDr. Zhang (M'00, SM'04) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from\nWuhan University, China, in 1994, 1996, and 1999, respectively, all in\ncomputer science.

These applications\nrequire finding, from among a large set of time series or trajectory data,\nthose that are similar to a query data (the similarity-based retrieval\nproblem). Most of this data are unclean, containing local time shifting\nand noise, while most of the previous work in this area has developed\ntechniques that work on clean data. In this talk, I address\nsimilarity-based retrieval of time series and trajectory data in the\npresence of local time shifting and noise.  In particular, I will present\ntwo novel distance functions: a metric distance function, called Edit\ndistance with Real Penalty (ERP), that can support local time shifting,\nand, Edit Distance on Real sequence (EDR) that can handle noise as well as\nlocal time shifting, but is not metric. Since the proposed distance\nfunctions are computationally expensive, I propose several indexing and\npruning methods to improve the retrieval efficiency. For ERP, a framework\nis developed to index time series or trajectory data under a metric\ndistance function, which exploits the pruning power of lowering bounding\nand triangle inequality.  For EDR, three pruning techniques mean value\nQ-grams, near triangle inequality, and histograms are developed to improve\nthe retrieval efficiency.

In this talk we focus on a special case known as\nthe network broadcasting problem in undirected networks, where a sender\nmust send all its data to a set of receivers and the objective is to\nmaximize the transmission rate subject to the capacity constraints in the\nnetwork. The following questions come up naturally.\n\n(1) \tHow to compute the maximum broadcasting rate if network coding\n\tis used?\n\n(2) \tHow to compute the maximum broadcasting rate if network coding is\n\tnot used?\n\n(3) \tHow big could the coding advantage be?\n\nWe model the first two questions as purely combinatorial problems, namely\nthe \"graph rooted-orientation\" problem and the \"Steiner tree packing\"\nproblem; both are generalizations of fundamental problems in graph theory.\nThen we show the hardness of both problems and present efficient\napproximation algorithms using techniques in combinatorial optimization.\nAs a consequence, a non-trivial upper bound on the third question is\nobtained.

It has become\nan indispensable tool for many scientists and engineers. The process of\ndata visualization is inherently iterative. A good visualization comes\nfrom experimenting with visualization and rendering parameters to bring\nout the most relevant information in the data. This iterative process if\nnot carefully designed can be tedious and costly. In addition to improved\nrendering software and hardware technologies, new interface technologies\nhave been designed to ease this process and thus reduce the cost of data\nvisualization.\n\nIn this talk I will introduce two such technologies. The first interface\ndesign employs an intelligent system to assist in the process of\ninteractive volume classification and visualization. The intelligent\nsystem makes possible the use of higher dimensional classifications for\ncomplex segmentation tasks. In particular, it allows the user to focus on\nthe data content and features of interest, rather than conducting manual\ntuning of multidimensional classification and rendering parameters. The\nsecond interface design facilitates sharing and reuse of the various\ninformation about data exploration to leverage the knowledge and\nexperience that scientists gain from visualizing their data. For types of\ndata visualization where the cost of producing images is high, and the\nrelationship between the rendering parameters and the image produced is\nless than obvious, a visual representation of the exploration process can\nmake the process more efficient and effective. Such a visual\nrepresentation can be used as an interface to the data analysis and\nvisualization process to dramatically improve explorability and facilitate\ncollaboration.\n\n\n************************\nBiography:\n\nProfessor Ma received his PhD in computer science from the University of\nUtah in 1993.

Syntactically, Markov logic\nis first-order logic augmented with a weight for each formula.\nSemantically, a set of Markov logic formulas represents a probability\ndistribution over possible worlds, in the form of a Markov network with\none feature per grounding of a formula in the set, with the corresponding\nweight. Formulas are learned from relational databases using inductive\nlogic programming techniques. Weights can be learned either generatively\n(using pseudo-likelihood optimization) or discriminatively (using a voted\nperceptron algorithm).

Finally, in the\nrepetitive pattern matching we aim at determining how long it takes for a\nprefix of a text to reappear somewhere in the text. We apply probabilistic\nand analytic tools of combinatorics and analysis of algorithms to discover\ngeneral laws of pattern occurrences. An immediate consequence of our\nresults is the possibility to set thresholds at which the appearance of a\npattern in given text starts being `meaningful'.\n\nIn this talk, we first discuss some applications of string matching\nmethodology to biological sequence analysis; in particular, to the problem\nof finding weak signals and avoiding artifacts.

The DNA sequencing and expression profiling\nrepresent two main modalities of genomic information sources. The genome\nis not just a collection of genes working in isolation, but it encompasses\nglobal and highly coordinated control of information to carry out a range\nof cellular functions. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct a\ngenome-wide exploration. Note that genome-wide analysis via pure DNA\nsequencing is computationally prohibitive. In contrast, expression of\nseveral thousands of genes can be measured simultaneously by DNA\nmicroarrays, thus permitting discovery of clusters of correlated genes.\nIt is obvious that microarray data analysis will play a vital role in the\nfuture genome-wide bioinformatic study.\n\nIt is crucial to know not only how to cluster data but also how to find\nappropriate way of looking at the genomic data. In other words,\nextraction of relevant features is critical for cluster discovery. We\nshall present a comprehensive set of coherence models to better capture\nthe biological relevant features of genes. In addition, we adopt as the\nclassification architecture several existing neural networks, e.g. SVM or\ndecision-based neural network (DBNN).  Our fusion model is built upon the\nclassic mixture-of-experts (MOE) architecture: (1) a local expert is\nassigned to cover each modality; (2) a gating agent is then adopted to\nfuse the local scores to reach a Bayesian optimal decision.

In\nrecent years, I/O-efficient algorithms have been a successive and active\ndirection to better scalability on massive data.  In this talk, I will\ndiscuss two topics from my thesis work on I/O-efficient algorithms and\ndata structures, with their applications in large spatial databases.\n\nThe union-find problem is one of the most fundamental algorithmic\nproblems. However, no I/O-efficient algorithm is known despite extensive\nstudy over the last four decades.  I will present the first I/O-efficient\nalgorithm for the batched (off-line) union-find problem, and illustrate\nhow it can be used in some important tasks in geographic information\nsystems. Experimental results show that the new algorithm gives\norder-of-magnitude improvement over previous methods on large data sets\nthat do not fit in memory.\n\nThe R-tree is a disk-based data structure that is commonly used in spatial\ndatabases.  Many R-tree variants have been proposed in the past 20 years\nsince its invention.  However, all existing R-trees are based on\nheuristics and have poor performance on bad data sets.  I will present the\npriority R-tree, which is the first R-tree variant that always answers a\nwindow query using the optimal number of I/Os.  Not only being\ntheoretically optimal, experiments show that the priority R-tree is also\nquite competitive compared with other popular R-trees on real-life and\nrelatively nicely distributed data, and outperforms them significantly on\nmore extreme data.\n\n\n\n*********************\nBiography:\n\nKe YI got his B.E. in Computer Science from Tsinghua University, China, in\n2001.

For\nthe current IEEE802.11a/b/g standards, this rate adjustment is limited to\nunicast traffic only. We consider a novel type of multi-rate mesh networks\nwhere a node can dynamically adjust its link layer multicast rates to its\nneighbours. In particular, we consider the problem of realising low\nlatency network-wide broadcast in this type of multi-rate wireless meshes.\nWe will first show that the multi-rate broadcast problem is significantly\ndifferent from the single-rate case. We will then present two algorithms\nfor achieving low latency broadcast in a multi-rate mesh which exploits\nboth wireless broadcast advantage and the multi-rate nature of the\nnetwork. The proposed algorithms allow us to study how the design of\nmulti-rate meshes can affect the broadcast latency.

Rigorous\ntesting of such systems is indispensable. Nevertheless, the\nstate-explosion problem, in which the size of a system grows exponentially\nwith the number of sequential or concurrent modules, is a severe obstacle\nto the generation of test cases for concurrent systems. Most existing\ntechniques sidestep the problem by ignoring the fact that a module is made\nup of sub-modules. To ease the testing of collaboration of modules, they\nseldom consider a concurrent module to be decomposable. My study shows\nthat there are non-trivial problems in generating test cases compositely.\n\nIn this talk, I shall present a key criterion to assure the conformity of\ntest cases for concurrent systems. I stipulate it in Communicating\nSequential Processes (CSP), which is an excellent tool for modeling these\nsystems. A process is the behavior pattern of an object. A concurrent\nsystem is modeled as processes that may be composed sequentially and\nconcurrently. The presented work supports both process composition and\nabstraction. It decomposes a given process into sequential compositions of\ncomponent processes. Each component can be anti-extended into abstract\nforms. Sequential and concurrent combinations of abstract forms can\nsubstitute their corresponding components in a process to give aggregated\nabstract forms. Since the given processes, components, and abstract forms\nare all processes, this approach can be applied compositely and\nrecursively. Mathematical theorems assure that these aggregated abstract\nprocesses are anti-extensions of the corresponding processes under\nwell-specified necessary and sufficient conditions. Hence, test cases\ngenerated from these processes will be conformance test cases for the\nimplementations. I apply the results to the testing of context-aware\nmiddleware-based systems via control flow graphs, which are mathematically\nsound abstractions of the original implementation under test. These\ncontrol flow graphs are augmented with data flow edges to facilitate the\ngeneration of context-oriented test cases. At the close of my talk, I\nshall present the experimental results on a comparison of our work with\nexisting approaches.\n\n\n\n********************\nBiography:\n\nWing-Kwong Chan is a post-doctorate fellow of the Department of Computer\nScience, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology He received\nhis Ph.D, M.Phil., and B.Eng (Computer Engineering) degrees, all from The\nUniversity of Hong Kong, in 2004, 1995, and 1993, respectively.

Standard representations of trees using pointers are quite\nwasteful of space, and could account for the dominant space cost in\napplications such as storing a suffix tree.

It uses surface signals to achieve a variety of\nrendering effects, including color mapping, bump mapping (where surface\nnormals are the signal), displacement mapping (geometry), and\nself-shadowing. To allow texture-mapping, a surface must first be\nparameterized onto the texture domain by assigning texture coordinates to\nits vertices. In the first part of this talk, I will present new metrics\nand algorithms to parameterize a 3D surface onto the 2D domain for the\npurpose of texture-mapping. As opposed to previous methods, our new\nmetrics directly minimize geometry and signal undersampling in the texture\ndomain. I will also present a novel parameterization algorithm that is\ninspired on multigrid methods and uses hierarchical techniques to\naccelerate the parameterization process and improve results. These methods\nallow for more efficient use of the texture-map, yielding significantly\nbetter results than previous approaches for storing signals over surfaces.\nSince these methods were published, several new parameterization\nalgorithms based on this work have been introduced.\n\nThe second part of this talk focuses on how to use this parameterization\nframework to render texture-mapped level-of-detail meshes. First, I will\ndescribe a method to parameterize a progressive mesh (PM) so that the same\ntexture-map can be used for all levels of detail. Then, I will present a\nnew view-dependent level of detail rendering system designed with modern\nGPU architectures in mind. Our method is the first out-of-core system to\nsupport texture mapping, including a mechanism for texture level of\ndetail. Our method is suitable for all classes of GPUs that provide basic\nvertex shader programmability, and is applicable for both out-of-core and\ninstanced geometry.

The monitor would say Gate 15, but the\nairline staff would say Gate 43 . . . or 19 or 33. ... Out on the tarmac,\nsome pilots didn't know where to park and passengers sat perspiring in\ntheir seats. K a computer gremlin had prevented the main air cargo\noperator, HACTL, from retrieving vital shipping information. As a result,\nfreight operations ground to a halt, and containers full of perishables\nrotted on the steamy tarmac\"\n\nThese are not isolated incidents. Serious problems in the development and\nintegration of large software systems are in fact very common. The\nproblems are so serious that US congress passed laws to mandate the reform\nof large scale information system development, acquisition and maintenance\n. This leads to creation of an architecture framework for system\nintegration .  In spite such efforts, the system development and\nintegration problems remain. Even in less ambitious typical commercial\nsystem development, debugging-and-testing account for 50 -75% of total\ndevelopment cost.\n\nLarge, networked system of systems is built with many components designed\nfor different requirements in the past and contains known and unknown\ndefects. They often have overly complex and unconstrained interactions.\nIndeed, major system failures often traced back to unexpected global\ninteractions that involve many components, not an isolated defect in one\nmodule.\n\nOn the other hand, it is worthy to note that in the current mission\nmanagement software of civil aviation, there are hundreds of reported\nresidual bugs but the flights remain safe. There are at least thousands of\nresidual bugs in the telecomm network and it remains highly reliable.\nThere are perhaps millions of bugs in the World Wide Web system of\nsystems, but it works quite acceptably. On an even large scale, United\nStates of America is a highly stable and evolvable system. It has grown\nand made truly remarkable progress by the metric of civilization, even\nthough many problems remain. And its basic components, human beings, are\ncomplex, error prone, and hard to test or verify. Complex but stable\nsystems are uncommon but have been built.\n\nThis talk presents an initial investigation on\n\n- The root-causes of large system failures and what needs to be done.\n- Structures that keep highly complex systems stable in spite of residual\n  errors.\n\n\n\n****************************\nBiography:\n\nLui Sha graduated with Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in 1985.

Although many recent studies developed efficient methods to\ncompute skyline objects in a specific space, the fundamental problem on\nthe semantics of skylines remains open: Why and in which subspaces is (or\nis not) an object in the skyline? Practically, users may also be\ninterested in the skylines in any subspaces. Then, what is the\nrelationship between the skylines in the subspaces and those in the\nsuper-spaces? How can we effectively analyze the subspace skylines? Can we\nefficiently compute skylines in various subspaces?\n\nIn this talk, I shall present our recent study on the semantics of\nskylines, which proposes the multidimensional subspace skyline analysis,\nand extends the full-space skyline computation to subspace skyline\ncomputation. The newly developed notions of skyline groups and decisive\nsubspaces concisely capture the semantics and the structures of skylines\nin various subspaces. Multidimensional roll-up and drill-down analysis is\nintroduced. We also develop an efficient algorithm, {Skyey}, to compute\nthe set of skyline groups and, for each subspace, the set of objects that\nare in the subspace skyline.

Microarray data analysis is a\nchallenging problem and has attracted enormous interests from researchers\nin science and engineering. Microarray data can be represented as a\nmatrix, in which rows correspond to genes and columns to conditions or\ntime points. In clustering, we perform classification along either the row\nor the column direction, while in biclustering we perform classification\nalong both row and column directions. In this seminar, I shall present our\nrecent work on microarray data clustering and biclustering. We have\ndevelop a competitive learning based method to find natural clusters in\nthe data and use partial knowledge as constraints to improve the stability\nof the clustering results. For time-series data, we have developed an\nautoregressive model based technique to analyse the spectral similarity\nbetween gene expression profiles. This method has identified gene\nregulations at different frequencies, in a way similar to frequency\ndivision in communication systems. Biclustering is often associated with\nthe stigma of being inherently intractable in general because of its\ncomputational complexity. We have recently developed a hyperplane model\nfor solving this problem. By separating different types of biclusters and\nfiltering out irrelevant data, our method can reduce the computational\ncomplexity substantially and extract large biclusters. The method has been\napplied to medical diagnosis using microarray data.\n\n\n********************\nBiography:\n\nHong Yan received his Ph.D. degree from Yale University.

Consequently, users can easily\naccess information without contributing any information or service to a\nP2P community. This leads to the \"free-riding\" problem and consequently,\nmost of the information requests are directed toward a small number of P2P\nnodes which are willing to share information or to provide service, hence,\nthe \"tragedy of the commons\" occurs. The aim of this work is to provide\nservice differentiation and incentive features to P2P networks so as to\nencourage all nodes to share information or services.\n\nWe first introduce a distributed resource distribution mechanism which has\na linear time complexity and it guarantees the \"Pareto-optimal\" resource\nallocation. Secondly, we model the whole resource request and distribution\nprocess as a competition game between all competing nodes. We show that\nthis game has a Nash equilibrium. To realize this game, we propose a\nprotocol such that all competing nodes can interact with the information\nproviding node such that Nash equilibra can be reached efficiently and\ndynamically.

I will present several methods and their implementations to\naddress the limits of existing methods by effectively solving the overlay\ntopology mismatch problems in P2P systems while retain the search scope.\nThese methods are scalable and completely distributed in the sense that\nthey do not require global knowledge of a large region overlay network\nwhen each node is optimizing the connections with its logical neighbors.\nIn the second part of the talk, I will describe current and future\nresearch issues in P2P systems.\n\n\n***********************\nBiography:\n\nYunhao Liu received his BS degree in Automation Department from Tsinghua\nUniversity, China, in 1995, and an MA degree in Beijing Foreign Studies\nUniversity, China, in 1997, and an MS and a Ph.D. degree in Computer\nScience and Engineering at Michigan State University in 2003 and 2004,\nrespectively.

From home appliances to aircraft and from medical devices to\npower distribution networks, embedded systems monitor and control our\nphysical world in a computational manner. Information processing performed\nin embedded systems is tightly integrated with physical processes and is\ncalled embedded computing. Embedded computing is becoming the universal\nintegrator for physical system. Although embedded computing has become\npervasive, researchers and engineers have been developing embedded\nsoftware without the necessary theories, methods, and tools. Nowadays, the\ncost of embedded computing systems development is primarily linked to\nprohibitively expensive embedded software integration and testing\ntechniques that rely almost exclusively on exhaustively testing of more or\nless complete versions of complex systems.  The rapidly growing demand for\nhigh-performance high-confidence embedded computing system is putting\ntremendous pressure on system engineers in the industry.\n\nDuring the last decade, significant progress has been achieved in the\nresearch field of hybrid systems towards establishing the theoretical\nfoundations and computational methods for embedded computing systems.\nHybrid system theory is linking the fields of computer science, control\nengineering, and mathematics with the unifying aim of aiming developing\nformal analysis and synthesis methods for embedded computing systems.\nHybrid systems are used as the mathematical models for embedded computing\nsystems because the dynamical interactions between discrete and continuous\ncomponents in the systems can be well captured in a unified modeling\nframework. Unique characteristics of embedded computing systems such as\nmulti-modal behaviors of reconfigurable embedded software, distributed\nconcurrent computation by means of synchronous or asynchronous\ncommunication channels and system robustness with respect to temporal and\nfunctional constraints can now be rigorously considered within the same\nframework.\n\nIn this talk, modeling, analysis and verification of various classes of\nhybrid systems will be introduced. In particular, special attention will\nbe paid to computational and simulation tools for hybrid systems.\nApplications ranging from networked sensors, power electronics and\nmulti-robot coordination will be covered.\n\n\n\n***********************\nBiography:\n\nT.

Inspired by the vision that future sensor networks will be\nlarge, dense and consist of sensor nodes with more local computation power\nand will engage more peer-to-peer communications, we developed a novel MAC\nprotocol for these large and dense wireless sensor networks.  This new\nprotocol uses a novel channel assignment scheme based on the pseudo-random\nconnection of a dense Cayley graph, hence the name, CPR (Cayley\nPseudo-Random) MAC protocol.\n\nToday's existing MAC protocols mostly consider a single channel or a small\nnumber of multiple channels.  In this talk, we explain how the CPR MAC\nprotocol explores the potential benefits of utilizing the entire\ncommunication bandwidth in a dense sensor network.  By utilizing all or\nmost of the available frequency channels, the CPR MAC protocol can support\nmany, simultaneous peer to peer communications.  Other features of the\nprotocol include minimal collisions due to fixed channel assignments and a\ndecentralized routing algorithm that avoids global time synchronization.\nThese features all help to minimize communication overheads associated\nwith collisions and time synchronization and therefore making the protocol\nenergy efficient.\n\n\n*************************\nBiography:\n\nProfessor Wendy Tang is an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer\nEngineering at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook.\nShe was born and raised in Hong Kong but pursued her higher education in\nthe United States.

These applications\nrequire finding, from among a large set of time series or trajectory data,\nthose that are similar to a query data (the similarity-based retrieval\nproblem). Most of this data are unclean, containing local time shifting\nand noise, while most of the previous work in this area has developed\ntechniques that work on clean data. In this talk, I address\nsimilarity-based retrieval of time series and trajectory data in the\npresence of local time shifting and noise. In particular, I will present\ntwo novel distance functions: a metric distance function, called Edit\ndistance with Real Penalty (ERP), that can support local time shifting,\nand, Edit Distance on Real sequence (EDR) that can handle noise as well as\nlocal time shifting, but is not metric. Since the proposed distance\nfunctions are computationally expensive, I propose several indexing and\npruning methods to improve the retrieval efficiency. For ERP, a framework\nis developed to index time series or trajectory data under a metric\ndistance function, which exploits the pruning power of lowering bounding\nand triangle inequality.

In particular\nseveral car manufacturer such Mercedes, Honda, General Motors, etc., in\npartnership with silicon vendors and software providers such Bosh,\nNextech, Microsoft etc. proposed a number of solutions to avoid possible\nrisks due to human mistakes and unpredictable road conditions. In the near\nfuture cars will be equipped with a broad range of sensors and\ncommunication systems. In particular, future vehicular networks are\nexpected to deploy short/mid range communication technology for\ninter-vehicle communications.  In addition to vehicle-vehicle\ncommunication (for safety, and automatic driving purposes), users will be\ninterested in accessing the multimedia-rich Internet from within the\nvehicular network. Vehicular networks will foster the user need of\nconnectivity while in motion thus challenging the design of current\nwireless networks. It is conceivable in the near-future that wireless\n\"hotspots\" experience flash crowds-like traffic arrival pattern. A common\nphenomena in the Internet today characterized by sudden and unpredicted\nincrease in popularity of on-line content. We propose SPAWN, a cooperative\nstrategy for content delivery and sharing in future vehicular networks.\nWe study the issues involved in using such a strategy from the standpoint\nof Vehicular Ad-Hoc networks. In particular, we show that not only content\nserver but also wireless access network load reduction is critical. We\npropose a \"communication efficient\" swarming protocol which uses a gossip\nmechanism that leverages the inherent broadcast nature of the wireless\nmedium, and a piece-selection strategy that takes proximity into account\nin decisions to exchange pieces.

With the\nproliferation of wireless enabled devices, and especially multi-radio/\nmulti-band enabled devices, much attention has been paid to the desire to\nensure \"always best connected\" system. Collaborative and cognitive\nnetworking (CCN) is proposed to make the devices cognitive to the\nenvironment and adapt to the best performance by end-system collaboration.\n\nAfter introducing the scope of CCN, I will present two concrete\ntechnologes, i.e., ProFITS and SoftMAC. ProFITS targets at seamless\nroaming across heterogeneous wireless networks such as wireless wide area\nnetwork (WWAN) and wireless local area network (WLAN). A novel seamless\nand proactive end-to-end mobility management system is presented, which\ncan maintain the connections based on the end-to-end principle by\nincorporating an intelligent network status detection mechanism. Two core\ncomponents of this system, i.e., connection manager (CM) and virtual\nconnectivity (VC), are introduced in detail. A prototype system is built\nto demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.\n\nTo address the VoIP delivery over multi-hop networks, Layer 2.5 SoftMAC\nthat resides between the 802.11 MAC layer and IP layer is proposed to\ncoordinate the real-time and best-effort packet transmission among\nneighboring nodes in a multi-hop wireless network. Distributed admission\ncontrol, rate control, and non-preemptive priority queueing is introduced\nto regulate the contention in the multi-hop system. We implement our\nproposed SoftMAC as a Windows Network Driver Interface Specification\n(NDIS) driver over Network Interface Card (NIC) driver, and build a\nmulti-hop wireless network testbed with 32 wireless nodes equipped with\n802.11 a/b/g combo cards.

The concept of power-awareness has been incorporated\ninto today's hardware and software development as an important design\ncriterion.\n\nOur work focuses on using scheduling techniques to improve energy efficiency\nin task processing and wireless data transmission/reception without\nviolating the QoS requirements of applications. We first address the issue\nof power-aware voltage scaling for real-time periodic tasks. The concept of\n\"blocking-awareness\" is introduced in the context of scheduling tasks with\nnon-preemptible sections. The proposed blocking-aware algorithms dynamically\nadjust the processor speed based on run-time blocking occurrences, therefore\nthey can greatly reduce processor energy consumption over static speed\nschemes.\n\nIn the second part, we will analyze the energy consumption of receiving\ncontinuous media streams in a WLAN environment. We point out that existing\nstandards are not energy efficient as they may cause mobile clients to wake\nup frequently and wait for an extended period of time before actual data\nreception. Combining power-aware scheduling and traffic shaping at the local\nproxy server, the propose wireless traffic scheduling schemes minimize the\nwaiting time of mobile clients and effectively reduce their energy\nconsumption. Furthermore, we extend our algorithms to take the residue\nbattery capacities of the clients into consideration so that clients at low\nbattery level could spend less energy and enjoy a prolonged battery life.\n\nIt is our wish that these analyses and algorithms will benefit the design of\nenergy-efficient computing and wireless communication software systems.\n\n\n\n\n*************************\nBiography:\n\nFan Zhang is currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science\nat HKUST.

Model-Based\nSoftware Development aims to elevate the level of abstraction from writing\ncode to building models that generate code, and enable analysis of system\nproperties at early design stages. One common interaction style for\nlarge-scale distributed RTE software is asynchronous message passing\nbetween components with ports. As part of the DARPA Model-Based\nIntegration of Embedded Software project, an integrated toolset for design\nand analysis of this class of software has been developed collaboratively\nby researchers from multiple institutions, with avionics mission computing\nfrom Boeing as an application example. I first discuss scalable\nlightweight static analysis techniques developed as part of the toolset\nfor verification of the software design models. I then address the problem\nof implementation synthesis, that is, given a logical software design\nmodel, how to synthesize a multi-threaded implementation that runs on a\ntarget hardware platform and satisfies timing constraints. Commercial code\ngenerators generate functional code, but leave the choice of concurrency\nand multi-threading strategies to the engineer.

Experimental evaluation shows that our techniques result in\nhigh-quality multi-threaded implementations within reasonable running\ntimes of the optimization algorithm.\n\n\n**********************\nBiography:\n\nZonghua Gu received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering\nfrom the University of Michigan in July 2004, and has been working as a\npost-doctoral researcher at the University of Virginia since then.

To handle web hotspots\neffectively, I developed DotSlash, a self-configuring and scalable rescue\nsystem.\n\nDotSlash allows different web sites to form a mutual-aid community, and\nuse spare capacity in the community to relieve web hotspots experienced by\nany individual site. As a rescue system, DotSlash intervenes when a web\nsite becomes heavily loaded, and is phased out once the workload returns\nto normal. The whole rescue process is self-managing in that service\ndiscovery is used to allow servers of different web sites to learn about\neach other dynamically, rescue actions are triggered automatically based\non load conditions, and a rescue server can serve the content of its\norigin serves on the fly without the need of any advance configuration. I\nhave implemented a prototype of DotSlash on top of Apache. Experiments\nshow that using DotSlash a web server can increase the request rate it\nsupported and the data rate it delivered to clients by an order of\nmagnitude.\n\nI also designed an extended version of DotSlash for dynamic content web\nsites, and evaluated it in the context of the widely used LAMP\nconfiguration (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP).

On the other hand, coding is more costly than routing.\nIn a fundamental graph theorem, Edmonds showed routing alone is sufficient\n(and therefore more cost-effective) to achieve the capacity, if the source\nis to broadcast data to all other nodes.  It is therefore natural to pose\na question on how to achieve the best of both worlds, namely reaching the\nmaximum throughput with minimum complexity. The answer hinges upon a new\ndiscovery that the optimal capacity can still be achieved under the\nrestriction that coding is used only on links entering relay nodes. This\nimportant finding is cast as a unified theor em which includes the\nabove-mentioned main theorems on network coding and routing as special\ncases.\n\nIn the second part of the talk, I will address optimal cross-layer designs\nof wireless networks. Using bit-rate resources as the currency, the\nphysical and medium access layers are modeled as the supply side and the\nnetwork layer is modeled as the demand side. To facilitate the joint\noptimization of the supply and demand, he reduced the supply side into a\ngraph coloring problem and the demand side into a network coding problem,\nboth expressible in linear inequalities. This approach explicitly reveals\nthe balance between the supply and demand and moreover, optimally exploits\nthe rich design freedom inherent in a wireless network. Under this model,\nthe minimum-energy multicast problem in mobile ad hoc networks can now be\nformulated as a linear optimization problem. The advantages over the\nconventional routing approach are two-fold: (1) better energy-efficiency,\nand (2) polynomial solvability instead of NP-hardness.\n\n\n******************\nBiography:\n\nProfessor S.Y.

This is followed by a\ndiscussion on the analysis and numerical results that show that\nmaintaining alpha-coverage is much more scalable than maintaining complete\ncoverage.\n\nFinally I will elaborate on the design of an algorithm that approaches the\nlifetime upper bound for maintaining alpha-coverage.  The simulation\nresults show that the proposed algorithm achieves 90% of the derived\nlifetime upper bound, which verifies both the tightness of the lifetime\nupper bound and the efficacy of the algorithm.\n\n\n*********************\nBiography:\n\nHonghai Zhang is a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and is expected to graduate in\nSummer 2005.

Environmental variations,\nwhich cause the signals to change from time to time even at the same\nlocation, present a challenging task for indoor location estimation in the\nIEEE 802.11b infrastructure. In such a dynamic environment, the radio maps\nobtained in one time period may not be applicable in other time periods.\nTo solve this problem, we apply a regression analysis to learn the\ntemporal predictive relationship between the signal-strength values\nreceived by sparsely located reference points and that received by the\nmobile device. This temporal prediction model can then be used for online\nlocalization based on the newly observed signal strength values at the\nclient side and the reference points. We show that this technique can\neffectively accommodate the variations of signal-strength values over\ndifferent time periods without the need to rebuild the radio maps\nrepeatedly.

As an\nalternative to the well established deterministic approaches,\nprobabilistic location determination techniques show good performance and\nbecome more and more popular. However, in order for these techniques to\nachieve a high level of accuracy, adequate training samples should be\ncollected offline for calibration. As a result, a great amount of manual\neffort is incurred. In this work, we aim to solve the problem by reducing\nboth the sampling time and the number of locations sampled in constructing\nthe radio map. A learning algorithm is proposed to build location\nestimation systems based on a small fraction of the calibration data\ntraditional techniques require and a collection of user traces that can be\ncheaply obtained. Our experiments show that unlabeled user traces can be\nused to compensate the effects of reducing calibration effort and even\nimprove the system performance.  Consequently, manual effort can be\nsignificantly reduced while a high level of accuracy is still achieved.\nThis is joint work with Professor Qiang Yang.\n\n\nBiography:\n\nXiaoyong Chai is currently an MPhil student at the Department of Computer\nScience, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

These location values are subsequently used to\nanswer user queries.  Due to continuous changes in locations, as well as\nlimited resources (e.g., network bandwidth and battery power), it is\ninfeasible for the database to keep track of the actual location of every\nmoving object. Queries that use the stale values provided by the database\ncan produce incorrect answers.  However, if the degree of uncertainty\nbetween the actual location value and the database value is limited, one\ncan place more confidence in answers to the queries. More generally, query\nanswers can be augmented with probabilistic guarantees of the validity of\nthe answers.  To answer these probabilistic queries, different solutions\nare required, depending on the moving pattern of an object, as well as the\nnature of the query. We first investigate the interesting issue of\nmodeling ``uncertainty'' for a moving-object.  Based on the uncertainty\nmodels, we will discuss how uncertain location data can be queried, where\nalgorithms for range queries and nearest-neighbor queries will be\npresented.\n\nWe observe that uncertainty management techniques for a moving-object\ndatabase can be generalized to a vast class of sensor-based applications,\nwhich typically involve the monitoring of continuously changing entities\n(e.g., temperature and pressure).  I will talk about a taxonomy of\nuncertainty models for general sensor data. These classes of models\ndescribe uncertainty in different levels of precision. Next, we will\npresent a classification scheme for probabilistic queries for uncertain\nsensor data, and briefly discuss how probabilistic queries are executed in\neach class. We also examine the important issue of measuring the quality\nof answers to probabilistic queries.\n\n\n***********************\n\nBiography:\n\nReynold Cheng received the B.Eng. degree in Computer Engineering and the\nM.Phil degree in Computer Science from the University of Hong Kong, in\n1998 and 2000, respectively.

Barsky  \n                  UC Berkeley, USA    \n\nTitle:            Vision-Realistic Rendering \n\nDate:             Wednesday, 02 June 2004 \n\nTime:             3:00pm - 4:00pm \n\nVenure:           Lecture Theatre F (Leung Yat Seng Lecture Theatre) \n                  (near lift nos. 25/26)   \n\n\nABSTRACT: \n\nWe introduce a new concept, called \"vision-realistic rendering\", a\nthree-dimensional rendering algorithm that simulates\nthe vision of a subject whose optical system is measured using wavefront\n\naberrometry.  The algorithm uses an input depth map to stratify an\ninitial image into disjoint depth plane images, extends these\ndepth plane images, convolves them with a special object-space blur\nfilter, and composites them to form a final vision-realistic rendered\nimage.\n\nVision-realistic rendering has many applications in optometry and\nophthalmology.  Such images could be shown to a\npatient's eye doctor to convey the specific visual anomalies of the\npatient.  Also, images could be generated using the\noptics of various ocular conditions, which would be valuable in\neducating doctors and patients about the specific\nvisual effects of these vision disorders. Furthermore, with the\nincreasing popularity of vision correction\nsurgeries such as PRK (photorefractive keratectomy) and LASIK (laser\nin-situ keratomileusis), our technique could be used to convey to\ndoctors what the vision of a patient is like before and after\nsurgery, using wavefront aberrometry measured pre- and post-operatively.\n\nIn addition, by using modeled or simulated wavefront measurements, this\napproach could provide accurate and revealing\nmedical visualizations of predicted visual acuity and of\nsimulated vision; such simulations could be shown to\npotential candidates for such surgery to enable them to make more\neducated decisions regarding undergoing the procedure.\n\nVision-realistic rendering also has applications in image synthesis and\ncomputer animation. It is important to note that\nthe creation of such images based on camera optics follows as a special\ncase of our algorithm. Thus, our approach could be used as a\npost-process to simulate camera model effects such as depth of field in\nthe\ngeneration of synthetic images and computer animation.\n\n\nBIOGRAPHY: \n\nBrian A.

Chess and Go are games of perfect knowledge but difficult \nto analyze. So Combinatorial Game Theory often either concentrates on simpler games such \nas Nim - a taking game with several heaps of possibly different sizes -, or attempts to \nsolve endgames and other special cases.\n\nThe class of impartial games allows both players to make any move for all game positions.\nIn 1930s, Sprague and Grundy developed a theory of impartial games in which Nim played a \nmost important role. According to the Sprague-Grundy theory, every position in an impartial \ngame can be assigned a Grundy number which makes it equivalent to a Nim heap of that size.\n\nWe will illustrate the Sprague-Grundy theory using the game of Kayles as an example.\nKayles was introduced by Dudeney and Loyd. It is played by two persons who move alternately.\nAll Kayles (pins) are arranged in a row. In one move a player may knock out either one or \ntwo adjacent pins. The player who can make the last move will win the game.\n\nBIOGRAPHY: \n\nGerhard Trippen received his M.Phil. degree in Computer Science from\nUniversitaet des Saarlandes, Saarbruecken, Germany.

Algebraic specifications can document interfaces \nunambiguously and accurately, and are thus desirable to augment informal \ndocumentation. Unfortunately, algebraic specifications are costly to \ndevelop. \n\nI present a system for reducing the cost of developing algebraic \nspecifications for Java classes. The system consists of two components: \nan algebraic specification discovery tool and an algebraic interpreter. \nThe first tool automatically discovers algebraic specifications from \nJava classes. The tool generates tests and captures the information it \nobserves during their execution as algebraic axioms. In practice, this \ntool is accurate, but not complete. Still, the discovered specifications \nare a good starting point for writing a specification. The second component \nof our system is the algebraic specification interpreter, which helps \ndevelopers in achieving specification completeness. Given an algebraic \nspecification of a class, the interpreter generates a rapid prototype \nwhich can be used within an application just like any regular Java class. \nWhen running an application that uses the rapid prototype, the interpreter \nprints error messages that tell the developer in which way the specification \nis incomplete. \n\nI conclude with ideas for future research, including distributed \nrefactoring, which has the potential to bring more flexibility to \nlibrary development while maintaining compatibility. \n\n\nBIOGRAPHY: \n\nJohannes Henkel is a Research Assistant at the University of Colorado at \nBoulder, working with Professor Amer Diwan.

Positional data is no longer\nlimited to our own Solar system, and we now have accurate position\ndata for stars, the interstellar medium, and even galaxies.  However,\ndue to the fact that the Universe is so gigantic in size and is\ndominated by empty space, modeling and rendering this huge environment is\na very different task compared with any ordinary three-dimensional\nvirtual environment.

In \ntesting such applications, the states of the database before and after \nexecution play an important role, along with the user's input and system \noutput. This talk describes AGENDA , a research prototype tool set for \ntesting DB application programs, with emphasis on AGENDA's techniques for \nchecking test results. AGENDA components populate the database, generate \ninputs, and check aspects of the correctness of output and new DB state. \nTwo levels of checks are used to check both database state and state \ntransition. The transition check validates the state transition performed \nby the transaction. The state check validates that the overall global \nconsistency properties hold for the new database state. We then discuss \nextensions to AGENDA for testing Web database applications. New testing \ntechniques that handle the unique features of these systems are needed. \nApplication source code is analyzed to extract relevant information.  A \ngraph is constructed in which nodes represent URLs and edges represent \nlinks between URLs. A set of paths through the graph is selected and test \ncases are generated for each path and then automatically executed. The \ncurrent implementation is targeted toward web applications written as Java\nServlets and uses an algorithm based on cyclomatic complexity to generate \npaths.

Users will interact with each other\nthrough such applications as video conferences, interactive television,\nand communal gaming. In order to have efficient group communications,\nwhether server-oriented or peer-based, multicast communication techniques\nshould be used.  The adaptation of multicast into commercial applications\nrequires security functionalities, such as authentication,\nnon-repudiation, and access control. Of these, access control is paramount\nas it is the first line of defense needed to protect the value of\napplication data.\n\nAccess control for group communications is addressed by multicast key\nmanagement techniques that concern key establishment/updating with dynamic\ngroup membership. However, the traditional literature for group key\nmanagement only provides generic constructions of the security structure.\nIn this talk, we will first introduce network-specific and\napplication-specific design for key management schemes that considers the\nvarying security and resource requirements of different applications,\nusers, and networks. The proposed design can improve the scalability of\nkey management.\n\nThe original design goal of key management scheme is to achieve access\ncontrol such that non-group members cannot access the multicast content.\nWe discover, however, key management can disclose the information about\nthe dynamics of the group membership, such as the group size and the\nnumber of join and departure users, to both inside and outside attackers.\nThis is a threat to applications with confidential group membership\ninformation. The second part of this talk will address the\nattack/anti-attack strategies for stealing/protecting group dynamic\ninformation in the existing key management schemes.\n\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nYan Sun received her B.S. degree from Beijing University, Beijing, China,\nin 1998.

The strategy consists in delaying\ncommunication until a mobile node moves close to its {\\em target}\npeer node, within an application-imposed deadline. We evaluate the\nperformance of various heuristics that, based on the movement history\nof the mobile node, estimate an optimal time (in the sense of least\nenergy use) of communication subject to the delay constraint. We\nevaluate the impact of node movement model, length of movement history\nmaintained, allowable delay, single hop versus multiple hop\ncommunication, and size of data transfer on the energy consumption. We\nalso present measurement results on an iPAQ pocket PC that quantify\nenergy consumption in executing the prediction algorithms. Our results\nshow that, with relatively simple and hence efficient prediction\nheuristics, energy savings in communication can significantly outweigh\nthe energy expenses in executing the prediction algorithms.

Web services are based on a set of XML standards such as\nSimple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Universal Description, Discovery and\nIntegration (UDDI) and Web Services Description Language (WSDL). The benefits\nof adopting Web services over traditional business-to-business applications\ninclude faster time to production, convergence of disparate business\nfunctionalities, a significant reduction in total cost of development, and \neasy to deploy business applications for trading partners. It is believed \nthat early adopters of Web services may include several industries that \ninvolve a set of diverse trading partners working closely together in a \nhighly competitive market such as insurance, financial services and high \ntechnology industries. This talk discusses Web Services Architecture (WSA) \nwith the XML standards on introductory level. To enable privacy protection \nfor Web service consumers across multiple domains and services, the World \nWide Web Consortium (W3C) published a document called ^OWeb Services \nArchitecture (WSA) Requirements^O that defines some specific privacy \nrequirements for Web services as a future research topic. In addition, this \ntalk also gives an overview of privacy access control issues in this context.\n\n\nBIOGRAPHY: \n\nPatrick is currently working as a Visiting Assistant Professor at the\nDepartment of Computer Science in the Hong Kong University of Science and\nTechnology (HKUST), and Patrick will be joining the School of Business and\nInformation Technology as a faculty member at a newly established\nuniversity in Canada called the University of Ontario Institute of\nTechnology (UOIT) in July 2004. Before that, he was working as a Research\nScientist with Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research\nOrganization (CSIRO) in Australia.\n\nPatrick has prior industrial experience in e-business projects in North\nAmerica and Hong Kong. From 2000 to present, Patrick has been serving as a\npanellist of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small\nBusiness Technology Transfer (STTR) programs of the National Science\nFoundation (NSF) in the USA.

Concrete standardization steps \ntowards supporting FVV have been taken. FVV aims at providing viewers \nboth stereo parallax and motion parallax. Depending on the rendering \nmethod, three coding technologies have been proposed based on depth, \ngeometry model or light field. I started studying light field duality \nin late 2002, with the purpose of replacing the then state-of-the-art \nsignal processing approach which applies only to uniformly sampled light \nfields. Based on the duality formulism, the equivalence between the\ngeometry-based and light field-based rendering methods can be rigorously \nproved. This paves the way for a unified FVV codec. In this presentation, \nI will introduce the duality concept and show how it leads to an elegant \nrendering algorithm that can be accelerated by off-the-shelf graphics \nhardware. I will also touch upon my recent proposal to MPEG about a \nunified multi-view coding approach. In practice, light fields cannot be \nexactly sampled. My colleagues and I have developed methods and \nrepresentations to estimate uncertainties associated with light field \nsamples. I will show how the uncertainty information can be used to \ngenerate probably correct novel views.\n\nBIOGRAPHY: \n\nDr. George Chen is currently a research manager at STMicroelectronics \nSan Diego Laboratory.

Thus it draws some connection to\nprevious work in this area, showing, in particular, that the\ncoincidence of constructive dimension with lower Kolmogorov\ncomplexity for infinite strings follows already from one of\nLevin's early theorems on optimal left computable semi-measures\nand their connection to Kolmogorov complexity.\n \nFurther on, the talk focuses on lower bounds to the Lyapunov\nexponent and Kolmogorov complexity via Hausdorff dimension. A\ntheorem showing the existence of an optimal computable martingale\nfor \\Sigma_2-definable sets is presented. From this one obtains\nan exact bound on lower Kolmogorov complexity for\n\\Sigma_2-definable sets.\n \nThen, based on theorems on the coincidence of Hausdorff dimension\nwith box counting dimension for sets having simple combinatorial\nproperties, lower bounds on Kolmogorov complexity for those sets\nare derived.\n\n\nBIOGRAPHY: \n\nProf. Ludwig Staiger received his Diml.-Math and Ph.D both from the \nUniversity of Jena, Germany.

If a positive flow x enters an arc, then x+g(a) units \nexit. Arcs may increase or consume flow, i.e., they are gainy or lossy.\nSuch networks have various applications, e.g., in data communication, \ntransportation and financial analysis.\n\nIn this talk we investigate the maximum flow and the minimum cost flow \nproblems. We show that the maximum low problem is strongly NP-hard, even \nin unit gain networks. It remains NP-hard, if all arcs are lossy. However, \nit becomes solvable in O(nm^2) time in unit loss networks. For the minimum \ncost flow problem we extend the successive shortest path algorithm from \nstandard to unit loss networks with almost the same running times.\n\nOur NP-results sharply contrast efficient polynomial time solutions of\nflow problems in generalized networks with multiplicative losses and gains.\nAlgorithmically, additive networks are harder than multiplicative networks.\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nProf. Dr. Franz J.

The ability to extract\nboth shape and motion from this matrix by a single SVD operation makes\nthis shape-from-motion approach attractive; however, it can not deal with\nmissing feature points and, in the presence of outliers, a direct SVD to\nthe matrix would yield highly unreliable shape and motion components. In\nthis talk, I will present an outlier correction scheme that iteratively\nupdates the elements of the image measurement matrix.  The magnitude and\nsign of the update to each element is dependent upon the residual robustly\nestimated in each iteration. The result is that outliers are corrected and\nretained, giving improved reconstruction and smaller reprojection errors.  \nThis iterative outlier correction scheme has been applied to both\nsynthesized and real video sequences.

Concurrently, new programming models and architectures have\nbeen developed for large-scale cluster computing, exemplified by recent\nMapReduce systems. However, these systems are designed for batch\nprocessing and require data set to be fully loaded into the cluster before\nrunning analytical queries, hence causing high delays of query answers.\n\nIn this talk, I present the design of a scalable, low-latency analytics\nplatform, called Scalla, that fundamentally transforms the existing\ncluster computing paradigm into an incremental parallel processing\nparadigm, which provides the combined benefits of massive parallelism,\nincremental answers, and I/O efficiency. Our technical contributions\ninclude replacing an existing popular mechanism for partitioned\nparallelism with a purely hash-based mechanism and using dynamic frequency\nanalysis to offer in-memory processing for most of the data. In this talk,\nI will also examine two application scenarios, click stream analysis,\nwhich has been used in our evaluation, and genomic data analysis, which is\npart of a large initiative on cloud services for massive-scale genomic\ndata processing and deep analysis.\n\n\n**********************\nBiography:\n\nYanlei Diao is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the\nUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst.

Most of them now leverage OpenFlow to\nenforce such path provisioning. However, this approach falls short of\nscalability because today's commodity switches only support a limited\nnumber of forwarding rules (1-4K).\n\nMotivated by this, we propose RoX, a simple yet novel idea of Routing over\neXplicit paths for data centers that preserves scalability. Our key\nmethodology is to harness cheap but much larger IP table (144K) in\ncommodity switches instead of expensive and scarce OpenFlow table to\nimplement explicit path control. At its very core, RoX builds on a simple\nconcept of path ID to express an end-to-end path, a bold idea of\npre-installing all desired paths between any source-destination pairs into\nIP tables, and an effective algorithm of paths to routing entries\ncompression that translates the idea into practice. We evaluate RoX on\nlarge DCNs to show its high scalability, and implement RoX with commodity\nswitches to show its readily deployment. We especially show that RoX\ndirectly benefits 5 representative applications, for example, from\nproviding the necessary bandwidth for provisioned IOPS to reducing the\nshuffle time of Map-reduce by over 300% over ECMP.\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nKai Chen is an Assistant Professor with the Department of Computer Science\nand Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong\nKong.

Yet, big data also offer us great opportunities. Some\nnonlinear phenomena or relations, which are not clear or cannot be\ninferred reliably from small and medium data, now become clear and can be\nlearned robustly from big data. Typically, the form of the nonlinearity is\nunknown to us, and needs to be learned from data as well. Being able to\nharness the nonlinear structures from big data could allow us to tackle\nproblems which are impossible before or obtain results which are far\nbetter than previous state-of-the-arts.\n\nNowadays, deep neural networks are the methods of choice when it comes to\nlarge scale nonlinear learning problems. What makes deep neural networks\nwork? Is there any general principle for tackling high dimensional\nnonlinear problems which we can learn from deep neural works? Can we\ndesign competitive or better alternatives based on such knowledge? To make\nprogress in these questions, we designed new nonparametric methods which\nare scalable in terms of memory, computation and dimensions. These methods\nallow us to do large scale \"lesion-and-replace\" experiments on existing\ndeep learning architectures, and investigate four crucial aspects on the\nusefulness of the fully connected layers, the advantage of the feature\nlearning process, the limitation of the gradient descent updates, and the\nimportance of the compositional structures.  Our results also point to\nsome promising directions for future research.\n\n\n********************\nBiography:\n\nLe Song is an assistant professor in the College of Computing, Georgia\nInstitute of Technology.

This talk argues that topic models themselves need attention. New\nways of modelling document semantics are being explored in the field of\ndeep neural networks. Similarly, non-parametric versions of topic models\nallow modelling such effects as document structure, word sparsity, word\nburstiness, background words, multi-word terms, and network effects from\nauthor or follower networks, and semantic word hierarchies. These are\nusually done in the spirit of deep neural networks using hierarchical\nmodels, but earlier algorithms were often too slow to be realistic.  This\ntalk will start with a brief tour of some of the variants, which can only\nbe superficial given the huge number. This will be followed by a brief\ntour of some non-parametric methods known to be moderately efficient and\nsuiting multi-core implementation.

The predictions from this theoretical\napproach are very powerful in a many-data situation, while the empirical study\nin general does not show the prediction even with many data. In this talk, I\nwill introduce how the powerful prediction for NN classification can be achieved\nthrough metric learning which is directly derived from the T. Cover's work.

In several contemporary machine learning\nproblems, the proposed method can be widely applied achieving state-of-the-art\nperformances, while the conventional metric learning algorithms do not make good\nperformances. In addition, I will show how our understanding of the theoretical\nproperties of NNs can be used to develop optimal strategies for NN\nclassification. Well-known heuristics such as the majority voting in k-NN\nclassification can be explained and exploited in this theoretical context.\nFinally, I will show how all of these understandings of NN behavior can motivate\nbetter usages of other nonparametric methods such as kernel Nadaraya-Watson\nestimator.\n\n\n****************\nBiography:\n\nDr. Yung-Kyun Noh is currently a BK assistant professor in the department of\nMechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Seoul National University (SNU).

They consist of similar, but\nnot identical, program changes to multiple contexts. Making such\nrepetitive modifications is a tedious and manual process. A failure to\nupdate all relevant change locations could lead to costly errors of\nomissions. In this talk, I will present approaches to automate program\ntransformations based on exemplar code changes provided by developers. By\ninferring systematic edits and relevant context from one or more exemplar\nchanges, our automated approaches can (1) apply similar changes to other\nlocations, (2) locate code that requires similar changes, and (3) refactor\ncode which undergoes systematic edits. The combination of these techniques\nopens a new way of helping developers automate tedious and error-prone\ntasks.

More specifically I will describe two Bayesian\nnonparametric priors; one over feature allocations for sequential data\ncalled the birth-death feature allocation process (BDFP) and one for\ntime-varying networks.\n\nThe BDFP models the evolution of the feature allocation of a set of\nobjects N across a covariate (e.g. time) by creating and deleting\nfeatures. A BDFP is exchangeable, projective, stationary and reversible,\nand its equilibrium distribution is given by the Indian buffet process\n(IBP). I will also present the de Finetti mixing distribution underlying\nthe BDFP that plays the role for the BDFP that the Beta process plays for\nthe Indian buffet process. The utility of this prior is demonstrated on\nsynthetic and real world data.\n\nThe prior over dynamic networks is an ongoing work. To each node of the\nnetwork is associated a positive parameter, modelling the sociability of\nthat nodes. Sociabilities are assumed to evolve over time, and are\nmodelled via a dynamic point process model. The model is able to (a)\ncapture smooth evolution of the interactions between nodes, allowing edges\nto appear/disappear over time (b) capture long term evolution of the\nsociabilities of the nodes (c) and yields sparse graphs, where the number\nof edges grows subquadratically with the number of nodes. The evolution of\nthe sociabilities is described by a tractable time-varying gamma process.\n\nWe provide some theoretical insights into the model.\n", "type": "Seminar", "name": ["Bayesian Nonparametric Models for Time Evolving Feature Allocations and Sparse Dynamic Networks"], "lenArticle": 289},

With a widespread use of 3D/4D imaging modalities\nlike MR, MDCT, ultrasound, or OCT in routine clinical practice, physicians\nare faced with ever-increasing amounts of image data to analyze and\nquantitative outcomes of such analyses are increasingly important. Yet,\ndaily interpretation of clinical images is still typically performed\nvisually and qualitatively, with quantitative analysis being an exception\nrather than the norm. Since performing organ/object segmentations in 3D or\n4D is infeasible for a human observer in clinical setting due to the time\nconstraints, quantitative and highly automated analysis methods must be\ndeveloped. Situation is similar when analyzing research animal images or\nbiological images of living cells from microscopic images.

This family of methods guarantees solution\noptimality with directly applicability to n-D problems.

Just\nas notable as the method's vast success is the research community's quest\nfor its efficient computation. The original KDD'96 paper claimed an\nalgorithm with O(n log n) running time, where n is the number of objects.\nUnfortunately, this is a mis-claim; and that algorithm actually requires\nO(n^2) time. There has been a fix in 2D space, where a genuine O(n log\nn)-time algorithm has been found. Looking for a fix for dimensionality d\n>= 3 is currently an important open problem.\n\nIn this talk, we will show that for d >=3, the DBSCAN problem requires\nOmega(n^{4/3}) time to solve, unless very significant breakthroughs --\nones widely believed to be impossible -- could be made in theoretical\ncomputer science. This (i) explains why the community's search for fixing\nthe aforementioned mis-claim has been futile for d >= 3, and (ii)\nindicates (sadly) that all DBSCAN algorithms must be intolerably slow even\non moderately large n in practice. We will also show that the running time\ncan be dramatically brought down to O(n) in expectation regardless of the\ndimensionality d, as soon as slight inaccuracy in the clustering results\nis permitted.\n\n**********************\nBiography:\n\nYufei TAO is a full professor in the Department of Computer Science and\nEngineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong.

The paper evaluates the\nperformance of progressive selfishness in terms of both application\nthroughput and energy consumption via extensive trace-driven simulations\nof realistic pedestrian behavior.

The results show that in certain scenarios\nprogressive selfishness achieves up to 85% energy savings during\nopportunistic downloads while sacrificing less than 1% in application\nthroughput.

The distortion of a\ncompressed graph is the maximum multiplicative blow-up of distances\nbetween all pairs of terminals. We study the trade-off between the number\nof non-terminals and the distortion. This problem generalizes the Steiner\nPoint Removal (SPR) problem, in which all non-terminals must be removed.\n\n\nWe introduce a novel black-box reduction to convert any lower bound on\ndistortion for the SPR problem into a super-linear lower bound on the\nnumber of non-terminals, with the same distortion, for our problem. This\nallows us to show that there exist graphs such that every minor with\ndistortion less than 2 / 2.5/ 3 must have \\Omega(k^2) / \\Omega(k^{5/4}) /\n\\Omega(k^{6/5}) non-terminals, plus more trade-offs in between. The\nblack-box reduction has an interesting consequence: if the tight lower\nbound on distortion for the SPR problem is super-constant, then allowing\nany linear (in k) non-terminals will not help improving the lower bound to\na constant.\n\nWe also build on the existing results on spanners, distance oracles and\nconnected 0-extensions to show a number of upper bounds for general\ngraphs, planar graphs, graphs that exclude a fixed minor and bounded\ntreewidth graphs. Among others, we show that any graph admits a minor with\nO(log k) distortion and O(k^2) non-terminals, and any planar graph admits\na minor with (1+epsilon) distortion and O(k^2 log^2 k / epsilon^2)\nnon-terminals.\n\nThis is joint work with Gramoz Goranci and Monika Henzinger; it will\nappear in ICALP 2016.\n\n\n********************\nBiography:\n\nYun Kuen Cheung received his MPhil (Mathematics) from the Hong Kong\nUniversity of Science and Technology.

Access latency and core network\ntraffic can be reduced by bringing content closer to the user. However,\ncaching in the access network suffers from two unavoidable technical\nproblems: 1) Due to the large number of caches to be deployed, each\nindividual cache has to be small (in comparison to the file catalogue),\nand hence only a negligible fraction of the catalog can be stored in a\nsingle cache. 2) The user population accessing a given cache at the access\nlevel is typically small compared to caching at the CDN level, and hence\nestimating the popularity of dynamic content in time is challenging.\n\nIn this talk, we present two methods based on content chunking to improve\ncaching efficiency. First, we focus on video content which represents a\nsignificant portion of the network traffic. Rarely do users watch online\ncontents entirely. Several video delivery platforms, such as YouTube,\ncollect statistics on the user engagement performance of their videos,\nusually called \"Audience retention rate\". We demonstrate how this\ninformation can be used to achieve a significant traffic reduction on the\ncore network. We characterize the performance upper bound of a cache able\nto store parts of videos and the best performance achievable by chunk-LRU.\nNext, we address the problem small sample sizes focusing on L local caches\nand one global cache. On one hand we show that the global cache learns L\ntimes faster by aggregating all requests from local caches, which improves\nhit rates. On the other hand, assuming locality of interest, aggregation\nwashes out local characteristics which leads to a hit rate penalty. This\nmotivates coordination mechanisms that combine global learning of\npopularity in clusters and LRU with prefetching.\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nLazaros Gkatzikis (S'09-M'13) received the Ph.D. degree in computer\nengineering and communications at the University of Thessaly, Volos,\nGreece.

This \npaper presents a data structure that reduces approximate nearest neighbor \nquery times for image patches in large datasets. Our new algorithm, \nPatchTable, offloads as much of the computation as possible to a \npre-computation stage that takes modest time, so patch queries can be as \nefficient as possible. The algorithm is based on a locality sensitive \nhashing scheme. We show experimentally that this accelerates the patch \nquery operation by up to 9x over k-coherence, up to 12x over TreeCANN, and \nup to 200x over PatchMatch. Our fast algorithm allows us to explore \nefficient and practical imaging and computational photography applications. \nWe show results for artistic video stylization, light field \nsuper-resolution, and multi-image inpainting.\n\nThe second paper is called \"Image Perforation: Automatically Accelerating \nImage Pipelines by Intelligently Skipping Samples.\" It will be presented at \nSIGGRAPH 2016. It presents a new optimization technique that can be used to \naccelerate image pipelines by automatically trading off between performance \nand accuracy. Image perforation works by transforming loops over the image \nat each pipeline stage into coarser loops that effectively ``skip'' certain \nsamples. These missing samples are reconstructed for later stages using a \nnumber of different interpolation strategies that are relatively \ninexpensive to perform compared to the original cost of computing the \nsample.

To achieve I/O-optimality, \nthe algorithm has to handle all the intermediate results carefully without \nwriting them to disk. Unlike the optimal internal memory join algorithm \nwhich has a nice tight bound (the AGM bound), the I/O-complexity of joins \nturns out to be quite complex or even unknown.

In both cases, effective\nalgorithms for these tasks must interrupt the input stream and decide\nwhen to provide output.\n\nSynchronous machine translation is when a sentence is being produced one\nword at a time in a foreign language and we want to produce a translation\nin English simultaneously (i.e., with as little delay between a foreign\nlanguage word and its English translation). This is particularly\ndifficult in verb-final languages like German or Japanese, where an\nEnglish translation can barely begin until the verb is seen. Effective\ntranslation thus requires predictions of unseen elements of the sentence\n(e.g., the main verb in German and Japanese, or relative clauses in\nJapanese, or post-positions in Japanese). We use reinforcement learning\nto decide when to trust our verb predictions. It must learn to balance\nincorrect translation versus timely translations, and must use those\npredictions to translate the sentence.\n\nFor question answering, we use a specially designed dataset that\nchallenges humans: a trivia game called quiz bowl. These questions are\nwritten so that they can be interrupted by someone who knows more about\nthe answer; that is, harder clues are at the start of the question and\neasier clues are at the end of the question. We create a recursive neural\nnetwork to predict answers from incomplete questions and use\nreinforcement learning to decide when to guess.  We are able to answer\nquestions earlier in the questions than most college trivia contestants.\n\n********************\nBiography:\n\nJordan Boyd-Graber is an assistant professor in the University of Colorado\nBoulder's Computer Science Department, formerly serving as an assistant\nprofessor at the University of Maryland.

Automated analysis tools are gradually becoming a\nnecessity. Specifically, static security analyses carry the promise of\nefficiently verifying large code bases. Yet, a critical usability barrier,\nhindering the adoption of static security analysis by developers, is the\nexcess of false reports. Current tools do not offer the user any direct\nmeans of customizing or cleansing the report. The user is thus left to\nreview hundreds, if not thousands, of potential warnings, and classify\nthem as either actionable or spurious. This is both burdensome and error\nprone, leaving developers disenchanted by static security checkers. In\nthis talk, I will address this challenge by proposing a general technique\nto refine the output of static security checkers. The key idea is to apply\nstatistical learning to the warnings output by the analysis based on user\nfeedback on a small set of warnings. This leads to an interactive\nsolution, whereby the user classifies a small fragment of the issues\nreported by the analysis, and the learning algorithm then classifies the\nremaining warnings automatically. An important aspect of this solution is\nthat it is user centric. The user can express different classification\npolicies, ranging from strong bias toward elimination of false warnings to\nstrong bias toward preservation of true warnings, which the filtering\nsystem then executes.\n\nI will present throughout the talk experimental data that validates this\nuser-centric approach. The experiments were done atop nearly 4,000\nclient-side JavaScript benchmarks, extracted from 675 popular Web sites,\nthat were manually annotated with vulnerabilities. The results show strong\npromise. As an example, based only on 200 classified warnings, and with a\npolicy biased toward preservation of true warnings, a learning approach\ncan boost precision by a threefold factor (\u00d72.868) while reducing recall\nby a negligible factor (\u00d71.006). Other policies are enforced with a\nsimilarly high level of efficacy.\n\n*****************\nBiography:\n\nOmer Tripp is a research staff member at the IBM T.J. Watson Research\nCenter in NY.

These problems involve finding a\nmatching between two groups of agents. The matching must be stable in the\nsense that it must be immune to unilateral defections (i.e., defections\ninvolving a pair of agents, one from each group). The classical algorithm\nfor finding stable matchings is the deferred acceptance algorithm of Gale\nand Shapely (DA). When each agent has preferences independent of the other\nagents, DA runs in polynomial time, always finds a stable matching, and\nhas a number of other nice properties. However, when complementarities\nexist between agent's preferences finding a stable matching often becomes\nNP-Complete. The practically important hospital residence matching\nproblem, where residents might be grouped into couples who have shared\npreferences (SMP-C), is an example of an NP-Hard stable matching problem.\nIn this talk we examine SAT and IP encodings for solving SMP-C. We arrive\nat a SAT encoding that works well in practice, and better than the IP\nencoding. We use the SAT encoding to investigate empirically the set of\nstable matches for matching problems generated according to different\ndistributions. This is joint work with Joanna Drummond and Andrew\nPerrault, both from the University of Toronto.\n\n**********************\nBiography:\n\nFahiem Bacchus is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of\nToronto His research fits broadly in the area of Knowledge Representation\nand Reasoning, a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence.

Elements from some ground set arrive one\nby one in rounds, and the algorithm maintains a feasible set that is\nindependent in the underlying matroid. In each round when a new\nelement arrives, the algorithm may accept the new element into its\nfeasible set and possibly remove elements from it, provided that the\nresulting set is still independent. The goal is to maximize the value\nof the final feasible set under some monotone submodular function.\n\nWe show that no deterministic monotone algorithm can be strictly\nbetter than 0.25-competitive even for partition matroids, the most\nmodest generalization of k-uniform matroids, matching the competitive\nratio by Chakrabarti and Kale (IPCO 2014) and Chekuri et al. (ICALP\n2015). Interestingly, we prove that randomized algorithms are strictly\nmore powerful by giving a (non-monotone) randomized algorithm for\npartition matroids with ratio 0.3178.\n\nThis is joint work with Zhiyi Huang, Shaofeng H.-C.

Given the incomplete information\nwe have about the processes involved, the frequently disappointing results\nobtained from attempts to use unsupervised learning to uncover latent\nlinguistic structures (e.g., part-of-speech sequences, syntax trees, or\nword alignments in parallel data) can be attributed---in large part---to\nmodel misspecification.\n\nThis work introduces a novel framework for unsupervised learning of\nstructured predictors with overlapping, global features. Each input's\nlatent representation is predicted conditional on the observable data\nusing a feature-rich conditional random field. Then a reconstruction of\nthe input is generated, conditional on the latent structure, as drawn from\ncheaply-estimated multinomials. The autoencoder structure enables\nefficient inference without unrealistic independence assumptions, enabling\nus to incorporate the often conflicting, overlapping theories (in the form\nof hand-crafted features) about how latent structures relate to observed\ndata in a coherent model. We contrast our approach with traditional joint\nunsupervised models that are learned to maximize the marginal likelihood\nof observed data. We show state-of-the-art results with instantiations of\nthe model for two canonical NLP tasks: part-of-speech induction and bitext\nword alignment, and show that training our model is substantially more\nefficient than training feature-rich models.\n\nThis is joint work with Waleed Ammar and Noah A.

The problem is notoriously hard due to the phenomenon named\n\"curse of dimensionality\", and it becomes even more challenging in the big\ndata era, calling for new ideas and methodologies.\n\nWhile there are numerous heuristic methods to solve this problem, methods\nbased on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) are arguable the most popular\nand promising approach as they have both rigorous theoretical guarantees\non space and time complexities and excellent query performance in\npractice. However, to achieve such performance, LSH-based methods require\nhuge amount of index. Recent work reduces the index size from\nO((nd)^{1.5}) to O(n log(n)) (n is the number of data points and d is the\ndimensionality), but the index is still typically an order of magnitude\nlarger than the size of the data.\n\nIn this talk, we present our recent breakthrough in this problem. We\npropose a novel method to solve the problem with theoretical guarantees\nand with a tiny index which is linear in n. Furthermore, our method\nsupports a variety of functionalities, such as finding the exact nearest\nneighbors with guaranteed probabilities. In the experiment, our methods\ndemonstrate superior performance against the state-of-the-art LSH-based\nmethods, and scale up well to a billion 128-dimensional points on a single\ncommodity PC.\n\n********************\nBiography:\n\nDr. Wei Wang is an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science\nand Engineering, The University of New South Wales, Australia.

It is well known that many FOMs will converge linearly if\nthe problem at hand possesses a certain Lipschitzian error bound. In\nthis talk, we shall present a new framework for establishing such\nerror bounds for a host of structured convex optimization problems.\nOur framework makes essential use of the notions of calmness and\nmetric subregularity from variational analysis. It not only unifies\nand simplifies the proofs of several existing error bounds but also\nleads to a new error bound for structured convex optimization with\nnuclear norm regularization. We believe that our techniques will have\nfurther applications in the development of error bounds and\nconvergence rate analysis of first-order methods.\n\nMore information on the CSE Theory Seminars can be found at\nhttp://www.cse.ust.hk/tcsc/seminars.html\n", "type": "Seminar", "name": ["A Unified Framework for Establishing Error Bounds for Structured Convex Optimization Problems"], "lenArticle": 177},

Group signatures allow members of a \ngroup to anonymously sign messages on behalf of the group. In order to \nprevent abuses, a group manager (called opener) is able to identify the \nsigner of a signature.  Full anonymity is a form of anonymity which is a \nsecurity requirement of group signatures. Intuitively, full anonymity \nrequires that any adversary except for the opener cannot extract the \nsigner's information from a signature. A full anonymous group signature \nscheme can be constructed from a public-key encryption scheme, a signature \nscheme, and an non-interactive zero-knowledge proof system.  Full anonymity \nis the most popular anonymity notion of group signatures. However it is \nslightly too strong since full anonymity requires that for a signature, \neven the signer of that signature is not able to know whether the signature \nis produced by him/her or not.  In this work, we construct a group \nsignature scheme from weaker primitives than those used in the construction \nof a full anonymous group signature scheme by requiring selfless anonymity \ninstead of full anonymity of group signatures. Selfless anonymity requires \nthat any adversary except for the opener and the signer cannot extract the \nsigner's information from a signature.\n\nPart III: In PKC 1999, Fujisaki and Okamoto showed how to convert any \npublic key encryption (PKE) scheme secure against chosen plaintext attacks \n(CPA) to a PKE scheme which is secure against chosen ciphertext attacks \n(CCA) in the random oracle model. Surprisingly, the resulting CCA secure \nscheme has almost the same efficiency as the underlying CPA secure scheme. \nMoreover, in J. Cryptology 2013, they proposed the more efficient \nconversion by using the hybrid encryption framework.  In this work, we \nclarify whether these two constructions are also secure in the sense of key \ndependent message security against chosen ciphertext attacks (KDM-CCA \nsecurity), under exactly the same assumptions on the building blocks as \nthose used by Fujisaki and Okamoto. Specifically, we show two results: \nFirstly, we show that the construction proposed in PKC 1999 does not \nsatisfy KDM-CCA security generally. Secondly, on the other hand, we show \nthat the construction proposed in J. Cryptology 2013 satisfies KDM-CCA \nsecurity.\n\n\nBiography\n\nI: Keisuke Tanaka is currently a professor at the Tokyo Institute of \nTechnology\n\nII:  Ai Ishida received her B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Tokyo Institute \nof Technology in 2013 and 2015, respectively. She is now a first grade \nPh.D. student at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

First, local relative\ncamera poses and 3D points are recovered from images by solving minimal\nmultiple view geometry problems with sparse image feature matching. Then,\nsuch local reconstructed cameras and 3D points are merged into a global\nreconstruction optimized by bundle adjustment. Finally, stereo\nreconstruction is carried out to generate dense point clouds and surfaces.\nAlthough the principles behind these techniques have been studied\nexhaustively over the past decades, the non-linear properties of the\noptimization and the complex connections in the parameter network make it\nvery challenging to reconstruct the world in 3D from millions of images.\nIn this talk, a series of works on adaptively resampling and partitioning\nthe reconstruction into smaller problems are presented to handle the\nlarge-scale 3D reconstruction. First, a stochastic sampling strategy is\npresented to resample the redundant 3D points according to quality\nassessment scores without compromising the quality of the local\nreconstruction. Then such an idea is extended to the space of cameras.\nBased on an image quality graph, a graph simplification procedure\nmaintaining the accuracy of the estimated cameras and completeness of the\nreconstruction is carried out to remove the redundant and bad cameras,\nyielding a faster and more robust global bundle adjustment. Such global\nbundle adjustment provides a global consistent coordinate frame for dense\npoint and surface reconstruction, but global bundle adjustment usually\nconverges to a non-zero residual and produces sub-optimal camera poses for\nlocal areas, which leads to loss of details for high-resolution\nreconstruction. Instead of trying harder to optimize everything globally,\nwe propose a segment-based approach to readjust the camera poses locally\nand improve the reconstruction for fine geometry details. In the end,\nseveral photo realistic results of city-scale 3D reconstruction will be\ndemonstrated in the talk.\n\n\n**********************\nBiography:\n\nDr. Tian FANG now is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Computer\nScience and Engineering, the Hong Kong University of Science and\nTechnology, where he received the Ph.D. degree in 2011 under the\nsupervision of Prof. Long Quan.

While much of the important technical knowledge can be\ncaptured in documentation, there often exists a gap between the\ninformation needs of software developers and the documentation structure.\nTo help developers access documentation more effectively, we are\ndeveloping approaches based on natural language processing to\nautomatically analyze and repackage software documentation into formats\nthat are more amenable to the readers of documentation. This talk will\nfocus on two such approaches: First, I will present TaskNav, a user\ninterface for search queries that suggests tasks automatically extracted\nfrom documentation in an auto-complete list along with concepts, code\nelements, and section headers. In a field study, we found search results\nidentified through extracted tasks to be more helpful to developers than\nthose found through concepts, code elements, and section headers. Second,\nI will present SISE, a machine learning based approach to automatically\naugment API documentation with \"insight sentences\" from Stack Overflow --\nsentences that are related to a particular API type and that provide\ninsight not contained in the API documentation of that type. In a\ncomparative study, we found that SISE resulted in the highest number of\nsentences that were considered to add useful information not found in the\nAPI documentation compared to several baseline approaches. These results\nindicate that natural language processing can be used to analyze and\nrepackage software documentation automatically, and that it can help\nbridge the gap between documentation structure and the information needs\nof software developers.\n\n\n********************\nBiography:\n\nChristoph Treude received his Diploma degree in computer\nscience/management information systems from the University of Siegen,\nGermany, and his PhD degree in computer science from the University of\nVictoria, Canada.

Of particular concern are\ndistributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which coordinate large\nnumbers of compromised machines to make a service unavailable to other\nusers. DDoS attacks are a constant security threat with over 20,000 DDoS\nattacks occurring globally every day. They cause tremendous damage to\nbusinesses and have catastrophic consequences for national security. In\nparticular, over the past few years, adversaries have started to turn\ntheir attention from traditional targets (e.g., end-point servers) to\nnon-traditional ones (e.g., ISP backbone links) to cause much larger\nattack impact.\n\nIn this presentation, I will review recent results regarding\nnon-traditional DDoS attacks and potential defense mechanisms. First, I\nwill review a non-traditional type of link-flooding attack, called the\nCrossfire attack, which targets and floods a set of network links in core\nInternet infrastructure, such as backbone links in large ISP networks.\nUsing Internet-scale measurements and simulations, I will show that the\nattack can cause huge connectivity losses to cities, states, or even\ncountries for hours or even days. Second, I will introduce the notion of\nthe routing bottlenecks, or small sets of network links that carry the\nvast majority of Internet routes, and show that it is a fundamental\nproperty of Internet design; i.e., it is a consequence of route-cost\nminimizations. I will also illustrate the pervasiveness of routing\nbottlenecks around the world, and measure their susceptibility to the\nCrossfire attack. Finally, I will explore the possibility of building a\npractical defense mechanism that effectively removes the advantages of\nDDoS adversaries and deters them from launching attacks. The proposed\ndefense mechanism utilizes a software-defined networking (SDN)\narchitecture to protect large ISP networks from non-traditional DDoS\nattacks.\n\n\n******************\nBiography:\n\nMin Suk Kang is a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(ECE) at Carnegie Mellon University.

Mobile terminals (MTs), equipped with multi-homing\ncapabilities, can explore network cooperation to simultaneously aggregate\nthe offered resources from different networks to support the same\napplication and thus increase the data rate.  On the other hand, as the\ngap between the MT energy demand and battery capacity continues to\nincrease, the MT operational time in between battery charging has become a\nsignificant factor in service quality. In this presentation, we introduce\nan energy management system for MTs to support a sustainable multi-homing\nvideo transmission, over the call duration, in a heterogeneous wireless\naccess medium. Through statistical video quality guarantee, the MT can\ndetermine a target video quality lower bound for a target call duration.\nThe target video quality lower bound captures the MT available energy at\nthe beginning of the call, the time varying bandwidth availability and\nchannel conditions at different radio interfaces, the target call\nduration, and the video packet characteristics in terms of distortion\nimpact, delay deadlines, and video packet encoding statistics. The MT then\nadapts its energy consumption to support at least the target video quality\nlower bound during the call. Simulation results demonstrate the superior\nperformance of the proposed framework over two benchmarks, and some\nperformance trade-offs.\n\n\n*****************\nBiography:\n\nWeihua Zhuang has been with the Department of Electrical and Computer\nEngineering, University of Waterloo, Canada, since 1993, where she is a\nProfessor and a Tier I Canada Research Chair in Wireless Communication\nNetworks.

By \"world knowledge\" we refer to\ngeneral-purpose knowledge collected from the Web, and that can be used to\nextract both common sense knowledge and diverse domain specific knowledge\nand thus help supervise machine learning algorithms.

Even worse, in most of\nsystems, multicast is by default sent at the base rate, wasting a\nconsiderable link margin available for delivering extra information. To\naddress this inefficiency, we present the design and implementation of\nHybridCast, a MU-MIMO system that enables joint unicast and multicast.\nHybridCast efficiently leverages the unused MIMO capability and link\nmargin to send unicast streams concurrently with a multicast session,\nwhile ensuring not to harm the achievable rate of multicasting. We\nevaluate the performance of HybridCast via both testbed experiments and\nsimulations. The results show that HybridCast always outperforms single\nmulticast transmission.\n\n\n*****************\nBiography:\n\nKate Ching-Ju Lin received the BS degree from the Department of Computer\nScience, National Tsing Hua University in 2003, and the PhD degree from\nthe Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, National Taiwan\nUniversity in 2009.

However, real-world statistics reveals that a large fraction\nof the energy is used to power idle servers when the workload is low.\nDynamic provisioning techniques aim at saving this portion of the energy,\nby turning off unnecessary servers. In dynamic provisioning, it is a\ncommon approach to predict future workload to certain extent and exploit\nthe information to achieve good performance. This naturally leads to the\nfollowing fundamental questions:\n\n- Can we design solutions that require zero future workload information,\ncalled online solutions, yet still achieve close-to-optimal performance?\n\n- Can we characterize the benefit of knowing future workload information\nin dynamic provisioning?\n\nIn this work, we seek answers to the above questions. In particular, we\ndevelop online dynamic provisioning solutions with and without future\nworkload information available. We first reveal an elegant structure of\nthe off-line dynamic provisioning problem, which allows us to characterize\nthe optimal solution in a \"divide-and-conquer\" manner. We then exploit\nthis insight to design two online algorithms with competitive ratios and ,\nrespectively, where is the normalized size of a look-ahead window in which\nexact workload prediction is available. We prove that these competitive\nratios are the best possible for deterministic and randomized algorithms;\nhence, they characterize the benefit of predicting future workload. A\nfundamental observation is that future workload information beyond the\nfull-size look-ahead window (corresponding to ) will not improve dynamic\nprovisioning performance. We remark that our results hold as long as the\noverall energy demands (including mainly server, cooling, and power\nconditioning) is a convex and increasing function in the total number of\nactive servers. Our algorithms are decentralized and easy to implement. We\ndemonstrate 20-71% of energy saving in a case study using real-world\ntraces.\n\nMore information can be found at\nhttp://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~mhchen/projects/dynamic.provisioning.in.data.centers.html\n\n\n*****************\nBiography:\n\nMinghua Chen received his B.Eng. and M.S. degrees from the Department of\nElectronic Engineering at Tsinghua University in 1999 and 2001,\nrespectively.

In the spectrum of parallelism, at the most\nchallenging end lies the category of Finite-State Machine (FSM)\napplications, which are also known as \"embarrassingly sequential\"\napplications. In these applications, the core computation can be\nformulated as an abstract machine with a finite number of possible states.\nTransitions among the states follow some predefined mechanism that can be\nrepresented with a state-transition graph.\n\nThe special difficulty for parallelizing FSM applications is as suggested\nby its nickname: They are inherently sequential. Dependences exist between\nevery two steps of their computations. For the extreme difficulty,\nparallelizing general FSM applications has been lying beyond the reach of\nexisting techniques.

While these techniques allow practitioners to obtain policies\nfor fairly large problems, they assume that a non-negligible amount of\ncomputation can be done between each decision point. In contrast, the\nrecent proliferation of mobile and embedded devices has lead to a surge of\napplications that could benefit from state of the art planning techniques\nif they can operate under severe constraints on computational resources.\nFor instance, consider the emerging class of monitoring and assistive\napplications that run on smart-phones, wearable systems or other mobile\ndevices.  While computational resources are rapidly increasing, energy\nconsumption remains an important bottleneck due to limited battery life.\nIn this talk, I will present some experiments about battery consumption\nfor various types of policies using a Nexus 4 phone. I will then present\nrecent results for the optimization and compilation of policies into\ncontrollers with negligible energy consumption during their execution.

CrowdER\nis a hybrid human-machine data cleaning system. I will describe how\nCrowdER combines humans with machines and achieves both good efficiency\nand high accuracy compared to machine-only or human-only alternatives. As\ndata volumes continue to grow, even with hybrid human-machine approaches,\ndata cleaning still becomes increasingly time consuming. To further reduce\ncleaning cost, I built SampleClean, a fast and accurate query processing\nsystem for dirty data.

Data access patterns in\nvarious applications are commonly characterized by the rank of popularity\nin a two dimensional graph: the data items are sorted (in the horizontal\naxis) by their access frequencies (in the vertical axis). Power law is a\nwell-known curve for this purpose, where a small portion of data (small\ndata) receives highly frequent accesses representing the locality of\nreferences, and a large portion of data (big data) receives infrequent\naccesses represented by a long tail in the graph. In the past 40 years,\ncomputer science researchers in both systems and applications made\neffective efforts on exploit the locality of small data by building deep\nmemory hierarchies in computer systems.  As the rapid advancements of\ncomputing and storage technologies, big data in the long tail has been\ndramatically increased and permanently archived, which has started to\nattract strong interests in many areas for both research and productions.\n\nIn this talk, I will present several case studies on both small data and\nbig data to show the distinguished natures and purposes on these two types\nof studies. For small data, the access patterns are largely predictable\nfor software and hardware design, and the main purpose is to improve the\nperformance and system utilization. For big data, the access patterns are\nlargely non-predicable, thus, the data processing environment must be\nmassive in a scalable and low cost mode.

The primary\nadvantages of WSC are the scalability and cost benefits for both the\nend-users and web-service companies. These WSCs house hundreds to\nthousands of machines to provide the computing resources needed to serve\nmillions of users. To limit the cost of ownership of WSCs, these machines\nare composed of commodity components which are cheap and easily\nreplaceable, often multi-cores. When multiple applications are running\nsimultaneously on a multi-core machine, resources sharing and contention\namong cores can result in a significant amount of performance\ninterference. This interference leads to a significant problem in meeting\nthe requirements of user facing web-service applications. To avoid the\nconstant unpredictable threat that shared resource contention poses to an\napplication's QoS, datacenter operators typically disallow co-locations of\nlatency-sensitive jobs with other jobs. This unnecessary over-provisioning\nof computer resources reduces the overall utilization of WSCs and results\nin an unnecessarily high cost and a large environmental footprint for a\ngiven set of web-service workloads. In this talk, I discuss these issues\nand present our research using scheduling and compiling to improve the\ncapability and cost effectiveness by improving resource efficiency.\nSpecifically, we reconcile the apparent conflict between the need to\nmaintain high QoS for latency-critical, high-priority services and the\ndesire to increase hardware utilization by scheduling multiple workloads\nper server.\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nMary Lou Soffa is the Owen R.

However,\neveryone may encounter occasions when receiving and expressing information\nvia a language is difficult. Therefore, people seek alternative ways to\ncommunicate when they fail to retrieve the exact concept.

Traditionally, manual\napproaches for constructing knowledge bases may not scale well, while the\nautomatic approaches via text mining may not explicitly reflect the\norganization of human mental lexicon.

The sheer size and dynamic nature of these workloads drive\nnetwork design tradeoffs.  For example, cellular network providers are\nscrambling for additional spectrum to support heavy network usage on\nmobile devices, and batched data processing jobs are straining network\ncapacity in data center networks.  In both cases, network architects must\nfind novel ways to support high traffic demands that vary significantly\nwith time, often without predictable patterns.\n\nIn this talk, I will present key results from our efforts to tackle the\nissue of traffic dynamics in both next generation wireless networks and\ndata centers.

Highly dynamic spectrum usage calls for on-demand auctions for\nfine-grain spectrum leases.  I will show that existing auction designs\nfail due to complex interference constraints in the wireless environment.\nOur solution is an eBay-like spectrum marketplace that auctions spectrum\nefficiently while achieving economic-robustness.  Second, I will describe\nchallenges in dealing with dynamic traffic hotspots in data center\nnetworks, where our solution is to use 3-D flexible wireless interconnects\nto augment wired networks.  I will identify key challenges of using\nwireless in data centers: link blockage and radio interference, and then\npresent 3D beamforming as a new wireless primitive to address them.\nFinally, I will discuss my plans for both short-term and long-term future\nwork.\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nXia Zhou is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science\nat Dartmouth College.

The\nlasting memory-wall problem of system design compounded with the newly\nemerged big-data problem of application practice has changed the landscape\nof computing. CPU speed is no longer the performance bottleneck of a\nhigh-end computing system, the data access speed is, whereas the data\naccess speed is limited by the performance of memory and file systems.\nConcurrency exists in memory and file systems. Historically, this\nconcurrency is designed and utilized around computing, not sustained data\naccessing. A paradigm shift is needed to support data-centric computing.\nIn this talk we introduce the memory parallelism concept. First, we review\nthe concurrency available in modern memory systems, and propose the C-AMAT\nformulation for system design analysis of concurrent data accesses. Next,\nwe illustrate the difference between memory-concurrency from a\ncomputing-centric view and memory-parallelism from a data-centric view,\nand discuss the considerations of utilizing parallel data access for big\ndata applications.

In many low-level vision problems,\nnot only it is known that the underlying structure of clean data is\nlow-rank, but the exact rank of clean data is also known. Yet, when\napplying conventional rank minimization for those problems, the objective\nfunction is formulated in a way that does not fully utilize a priori\ntarget rank information about the problems. This observation motivates us\nto investigate whether there is a better alternative solution when using\nrank minimization.\n\nIn this work, instead of minimizing the nuclear norm, we propose to\nminimize the partial sum of singular values. The proposed objective\nfunction implicitly encourages the target rank constraint in rank\nminimization. Our experimental analyses show that our approach performs\nbetter than conventional rank minimization when the number of samples is\ndeficient, while the solutions obtained by the two approaches are almost\nidentical when the number of samples is more than sufficient. We apply our\napproach to various low-level vision problems, e.g. high dynamic range\nimaging, photometric stereo and image alignment, and show that our results\noutperform those obtained by the conventional nuclear norm rank\nminimization method.

Despite decades of\nobservation and studies, collective behaviors are particularly not well\nunderstood for groups with non-uniform spatial distribution and\nheterogeneous behavior characteristics, such as pedestrian and vehicle\ntraffic in urban scenes, evacuation flows in complex structures, and\ncoupled human-natural systems.\n\nIn this talk, the speaker will survey some recent efforts on addressing\nthe problem of modeling, simulating, and directing virtual agents in\ncomplex dynamic environments. In particular, she will describe several\ncomplementary approaches for local collision avoidance, global navigation,\nand flow control of multiple entities, including both crowds and traffic,\nin urban scenes and city highways. The speaker will further highlight the\nchallenges of designing scalable algorithms for these problems by taking\nadvantages of parallelism available on emerging commodity hardware, such\nas graphics processing units and manycore processors. She will present\npotential opportunities of modeling a dynamic cityscape and their\napplication in large-scale motion synthesis, and coordination of multiple\nautonomous agents in computer games, virtual environments, and digital\nmedia.

With our growing dependence\non cloud services for both commercial and personal use, their reliability\nand availability have become increasingly critical. Despite existing\n(mostly ad hoc) approaches to improving the cloud service reliability and\navailability, a recent report found that on average, a service outage\nlasts about 134 minutes, and these service outages cost about $426 billion\nof loss worldwide annually. In addition, existing SLAs are often loosely\ndefined, and lack of reliability/availability guarantees has been cited as\nthe top concern over cloud services among IT professionals in a 2012\nglobal survey. In this talk, I will discuss both the challenges and\nopportunities related to service availability prediction, resource\nprovisioning, and SLA contract design from the perspective of cloud\nservice providers, and present our work on cost-effective solutions to\nproblems ranging from creating survivable virtual infrastructures in a\ndistributed multi-datacenter environment, to availability-aware VM\nplacement/allocation.\n\n\nBiography:\n\nChunming Qiao directs the Lab for Advanced Network Design, Analysis, and\nResearch (LANDER) at SUNY Buffalo with current foci on cyber\ntransportation systems, cloud computing, and smartphone systems.\n\nHe has published extensively with an h-index of about 60 (according to\nGoogle Scholar), and is among the Top 100 Authors in Computer Science,\nNetworks and Communications according to Microsoft Academic Ranking.

Many different approaches have been\nproposed to overcome this type of failures.  One of them is the goal-based\nrequirements engineering approach.  For example, i* is an agent-based approach\nused to supplement the traditional how and what aspects of requirements by\ngathering the why aspect of early phase requirements.  In this talk, we propose\nto extend the why part to include the internal view of organizational actors\n(e.g., reasoning and learning).  Our approach is based on the intelligent agent\nwork in the artificial intelligence field but used them for requirements\ngathering.  Since requirements gathering is different from producing artificial\nintelligence in computers, we developed our internal view constructs based on\nadditional theories such as the theory of affordances, feedback system theory,\nand the Bunge-Wand-Weber ontology.  These internal view constructs provide an\nadditional dimension for systems analysts to understand the why part of\nrequirements.  To better understand the utility of our proposed contructs,\nwe conducted an empirical study to compare our approach and the i* framework.\nThe result shows that including the internal view of organizational actors\nfacilitated users in performing their problem-solving tasks.  This opens up\nopportunities to further study internal view constructs of organizational actor.\n \n*******************\nShort Bio:\nCarson Woo is Stanley Kwok Professor of Business, Sauder School of Business,\nUniversity of British Columbia, and an associate member of the Department of\nComputer Science at the same University.

Many real\napplications in computer science, bioinformatics, chemistry, physics,\nhealth-care, and geology require efficient and effective management of\ngraph structured data.  In this talk, I will first introduce the iGraph\nframework (VLDB 2010, VLDB 2013) for supporting subgraph indexing and\nsubgraph isomorphism algorithm. Subgraph isomorphism has many important\napplications such as motif search in bioinformatics, chemical compound\nsearch in chemistry, social network search, RDF query processing, and\nmalware detection in computer science. Next, I will introduce a novel\nsubgraph isomorphism algorithm called Turbo$_{ISO} (SIGMOD 2013), which\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by up to orders of\nmagnitude. I will also introduce TurboGraph (KDD 2013), which is a graph\nanalytics engine that I am currently developing. TurboGraph is the first\ntruly parallel graph engine that exploits 1) full parallelism including\nmulti-core parallelism and FlashSSD IO parallelism and 2) full overlap of\nCPU processing and I/O processing as much as possible. TurboGraph enables\nus to process billion-scale graphs on a just single PC, while many\nexisting distributed approaches need hundreds or thousands of machines to\nachieve similar performance. Thus, for the first time,TurboGraph will\nserve as a core technology to open trillion-scale graph analytics with\nwell less than 100 machines. I will also briefly explain OPT, a disk-based\nparallel graph triangulation method which was accepted to SIGMOD 2014.\n\n\n****************\nBiography:\n\nProfessor Wook-Shin Han is currently an Associate Professor in the\nDepartment of Creative IT Engineering and the Department of Computer\nScience and Engineering in POSTECH.

The research on machine\ntranslation (MT) for Chinese and Portuguese languages aims to seek for\nsolutions to improve the way how people communicate and deal with\ninformation of different languages. The translation of Chinese and\nPortuguese is complex and presents many challenges due to the various\nsyntactic varieties, and the fact that Chinese and Portuguese belong to\ndifferent language families.

English, for instance, provides various ways for talking about\nobjects using many spatial relations such as front, back, up etc.\nImportantly, English allows to use these different spatial relations in\nmany different conceptualization strategies. For instance, spatial\nrelations can be used in group-based reference (adjectives), or to denote\nregions (prepositional use). Another type of evidence for the complexity\nof Natural language semantics comes from the analysis of cross-cultural\nvariation which shows that languages other than English have found\nradically different ways for conceptualizing reality. E.g. Tzeltal\nspeakers exclusively use absolute spatial relations such as\nuphill/downhill for talking about objects. These findings point to\nsemantics as an evolutionary system in itself with wide-ranging impact on\nthe evolution of language as a whole.\n\nThis talk will discuss a computational system that allows to model complex\nconceptualizations underlying natural language, and enables robots to\nautomatically conceptualize the world. The second part of the talk details\nhow the system can be used to investigate the evolution of rich,\nopen-ended semantics similar to those found in natural language.

Today, there is consensus among machine learning and\ndata mining communities that data volume presents an immediate challenge\npertaining to the scalability issue. However, when addressing volume in\nBig data analytics, researchers have taken a one-sided study of volume,\nwhich is the \"Big instance size\" factor of the data. The flip side of\nvolume which is the dimensionality factor of Big data, on the other hand,\nhas received much lesser attention. In this talk, I will present an\nattempt to fill in this gap and places special focus on this relatively\nunder-explored topic of ultrahigh dimensionality. Specifically, I first\nreformulate the resultant non-convex problem as a convex semi-infinite\nprogramming (SIP) problem, and then present an efficient feature\ngenerating paradigm to solve it. The proposed feature generating paradigm\nis guaranteed to converge globally under mild conditions. In addition, it\ncan achieve lower feature selection bias compared with the L1-regularized\nmethods. To speed up the training on big data (w.r.t. dataset size),\nseveral speedup strategies are explored under the proposed feature\ngenerating paradigm. Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of\nsynthetic and real-world datasets with tens of million data points and\nO(10^14) dimensions demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superb\nperformances compared with state-of-the-art feature selection methods in\nterms of generalization performance and training efficiency.\n\n*****************\nBiography:\n\nIvor W.

Dependability has to be engineered into a system in its early\nstage of design and development task to build comprehensive understanding\nof its nature and purposeful behavior within the context of people,\ntechnology and the process. Among many dependability attributes, we focus\non the security attribute and its certification and accreditation process\nthat aggregates evidences for multi-dimensional analysis to assure its\nlevel of acceptance. Security breaches most often occur due to a cascading\neffect of failure among security constraints that collectively contribute\nto overall secure system behavior in a socio-technical environment.\nTherefore, during security certification activities, analysts must\nsystematically take into account the nexus of causal chains that exist\namong security constraints imposed by regulatory requirements. Numerous\nregulatory requirements specified in natural language documents or listed\nin spreadsheets/databases do not facilitate such analysis. We present a\nstep-wise methodology to discover and understand the multi-dimensional\ncorrelations among regulatory requirements for the purpose of\nunderstanding the potential for risk due to non-compliance during system\noperation. Our lattice algebraic computational model helps estimate the\ncollective adequacy of diverse security constraints imposed by regulatory\nrequirements and their interdependencies with each other in a bounded\nscenario of investigation. Abstractions and visual metaphors combine human\nintuition with metrics available from the methodology to improve the\nunderstanding of risk based on the level of compliance with regulatory\nrequirements. In addition, a problem domain ontology that classifies and\ncategorizes regulatory requirements from multiple dimensions of a\nsocio-technical environment promotes a common understanding among\nstakeholders during certification and accreditation activities. A\npreliminary empirical investigation of our theoretical propositions has\nbeen conducted in the domain of The United States Department of Defense\nInformation Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process\n(DITSCAP). This work contributes a novel approach to understand the level\nof compliance with regulatory requirements in terms of the potential for\nrisk during system operation.

In this talk, I will summarize our recent\nefforts to unify recognition and reconstruction to reach a more\ncomplete understanding of a scene, by leveraging a huge amount of\ndata.

At its core, by\nexploiting runtime reconfigurable optical devices, OSA flexibly adapts its\ntopology and link capacities to various traffic patterns and thus achieves\nhigh network bisection bandwidth. The key idea I hope to deliver via OSA\nis that: a thin but flexible architecture, instead of a static fat one,\ncan better support data center networking in a simple, power-efficient and\ncost-effective way. We have evaluated and validated our system via\nextensive analysis, simulations and prototype implementations. In the\ntalk, I will summarize my previous work and foresee the future research.\n\n\n*****************\nBiography:\n\nKai Chen is an Assistant Professor of the Department of Computer Science\nand Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

However\nthe ASR problem is still far from being solved because not all information\navailable in the speech knowledge hierarchy can be directly and\neffectively integrated into state-of-the-art systems to improve ASR\nperformance and enhance system robustness. It is believed that some of the\ncurrent knowledge insufficiency issues can be partially addressed by\nprocessing techniques that can take advantage of the full set of acoustic\nand language information in speech. On the other hand in human speech\nrecognition (HSR) and spectrogram reading we often determine the\nlinguistic identity of a sound based on detected cues and evidences that\nexist at various levels of the speech knowledge hierarchy, ranging from\nacoustic phonetics to syntax and semantics. This calls for a bottom-up\nknowledge integration framework that links speech processing with\ninformation extraction, by spotting speech cues with a bank of attribute\ndetectors, weighing and combining acoustic evidences to form cognitive\nhypotheses, and verifying these theories until a consistent recognition\ndecision can be reached. The recently proposed ASAT (automatic speech\nattribute transcription) framework is an attempt to mimic some HSR\ncapabilities with asynchronous speech event detection followed by\nbottom-up speech knowledge integration and verification. In the last few\nyears it has demonstrated potentials and offered insights in\ndetection-based speech processing and information extraction.\n\nThis presentation is intended to illustrate new possibilities of future\nspeech via linking analysis and processing of raw speech signals with\nextracting multiple layers of useful information. We will also demonstrate\nthat the same methodology used in speech attribute detection and knowledge\nintegration can be extended to extracting language information from\nheterogeneous media signals for multimedia event detection (MED) and\nmultimedia event recounting (MER).\n\n\n******************\nBiography:\n\nChin-Hui Lee is a professor at School of Electrical and Computer\nEngineering, Georgia Institute of Technology.

Even coarse artistic\nsketches are surprisingly effective at unambiguously conveying complex 3D\nshapes.  While artistic guidelines provide many useful hints as to how to\ndescribe shape effectively, very little is known as to why these tools are\neffective and what geometric properties of the described shapes they\ncapture.\n\nOur work combines artistic guidelines and insights from perception\nliterature to introduce an explicit mathematical formulation of the\nrelationships between the communication tools used by artists and the\ngeometric properties they aim to convey.  In this talk I'll discuss the\napplication of the developed mathematical formalism to two challenging\ncomputer graphics problems: shading of concept sketches and surfacing of\nartist designed 3D wireframe models.\n\nThe first framework facilitates the creation of 3D-looking shaded\nproduction drawings from concept sketches. The key to our approach is a\nclass of commonly used construction curves known as cross-sections that\nfunction as an aid to both sketch creation and viewer understanding of the\ndepicted 3D shape. In particular, intersections of these curves, or\ncross-hairs, convey valuable 3D information, that viewers compose into a\nmental model of the overall sketch. We use these artist-drawn\ncross-sections to automatically infer the 3D normal across the sketch,\nenabling believable 3D-like rendering. We validate our formulation and\nalgorithm through a user study and a ground truth normal comparison.\n\nThe second problem I'll briefly address is surfacing, and specifically\nquadrangulation of closed 3D curves created by artists via sketch-based or\nother curve modeling systems. We use the input curves to both conceive and\nconstruct the quad-mesh of an artist imagined surface bounded by them. We\nobserve that viewers complete the intended shape by envisioning a dense\nnetwork of smooth, gradually changing, flow-lines that interpolates the\ninput curves. Our algorithm mimics this behavior and interpolates the\ninput curves by a network of quadrilateral cycles whose iso-lines define\nthe desired flow line network.\n\nMore information is available at:\nhttp://www.crossshade.com/\nhttp://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/imager/tr/2012/Quadrangulation/\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nAlla Sheffer is an associate professor in the Computer Science department\nat the University of British Columbia.

In particular, many computational problems that arise from\nelectronic commerce rely on the private data of self-interested agents. So\nthe algorithms not only need to deal with usual computational resource\nlimitations but also the new constraints imposed by social, economic, and\npersonal considerations.\n\nOn the one hand, algorithmic mechanism design studies the game-theoretic\nperspective of private data, aiming to incentivize truthful behavior by\nensuring that truth-telling maximizes the \"one-shot\" utilities of the\nagents, i.e., the utilities directly generated from the outcome of the\nmechanism On the other hand, differential privacy considers the privacy\nperspective of private data, focusing on the agents' concern on the\npotential leak of their private data by the mechanism, which may harm\ntheir utilities in the future. Finally, there has been a recent direction\nof research aiming to handle both perspectives simultaneously by combining\nthe techniques from both fields.\n\nIn this talk, I will give an overview of my contributions to these three\ntopics. (1) For the game-theoretic perspective, we advance the technique\nof black-box reductions in mechanism design, reducing a large family of\nmechanism design problems to the better-understood algorithm design\nproblems, including all problems in Bayesian setting and all\nsingle-parameter and symmetric problems in prior-free setting. (2) For the\nprivacy perspective, we introduce the technique of low-sensitivity metric\nembedding and propose efficient and differentially private mechanisms for\na sub-class of query release problems. Our result is among the first to\ncircumvent the known impossibility results for general query release\nproblems. (3) Finally, we propose the first general technique for\ndesigning mechanisms that handle both the game-theoretic and the privacy\nperspectives simultaneously for any mechanism design problems.\n\n********************\nBiography:\n\nZhiyi Huang is a graduate student in computer and information science at\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, advised by Prof. Sampath Kannan and Prof.\nAaron Roth.

Spatial structures also determine the\nways we think about our environment and how we solve spatial problems\nabstractly. When we use graphics to visualize certain aspects of spatial\nand non-spatial entities, we exploit the power of spatial structures to\nbetter understand important relationships. We also are able to imagine\nspatial structures and to apply mental operations to them. Similarly, the\nstructure of time determines the course of events in cognitive processing.\nIn my talk I will present knowledge representation research in spatial\ncognition. I will demonstrate the power of spatial structures in\ncomparison to formal descriptions that are conventionally used for\nspatial problem solving in computer science. I suggest that spatial and\ntemporal structures can be exploited for the design of powerful 'spatial\ncomputers'.

We\nrevisit the regular-expression matching problem with respect to\nprefix-freeness of the pattern. It is known that a prefix-free pattern\ngives only a linear number of matching substrings in the size of an input\ntext whereas there are a quadratic number of matching substrings for\ngeneral regular expressions. We improve the previous algorithm and suggest\nan efficient algorithm that finds all pairs (start, end) of start and end\npositions of all matching substrings with a single scan of the input when\nthe pattern is a prefix-free regular expression.\n\n\n3.      \"Orchestration by approximation: mapping stream programs onto\n         multicore architectures\"\n         by Dr. Bernd BURGSTALLER\n\nAbstract:\n\nWe present a novel 2-approximation algorithm for deploying stream graphs\non multicore computers and a stream graph transformation that eliminates\nbottlenecks. The key technical insight is a data rate transfer model that\nenables the computation of a \"closed form\", i.e., the data rate transfer\nfunction of an actor depending on the arrival rate of the stream program.\nA combinatorial optimization problem uses the closed form to maximize the\nthroughput of the stream program. Although the problem is inherently\nNP-hard, we present an efficient and effective 2-approximation algorithm\nthat provides a lower bound on the quality of the solution. We introduce a\ntransformation that uses the closed form to identify and eliminate\nbottlenecks.\n\nWe show experimentally that state-of-the art integer linear programming\napproaches for orchestrating stream graphs are (1) intractable or at least\nimpractical for larger stream graphs and larger number of processors and\n(2) our 2-approximation algorithm is highly efficient and its results are\nclose to the optimal solution for a standard set of StreamIt benchmark\nprograms.\n\n\n************************\nBiography:\n\nYo-Sub HAN\n\nYo-Sub HAN obtained his Ph.D. in computer science from HKUST in 2006.

The feasibility of using a policy combination of restricting\nstubs to provider-aggregatable addressing only, and disallowing stub-level\nreachability from being propagated into the global routing tables, is\nstudied. This policy combination results in significantly smaller global\nrouting tables but creates four challenges of address renumbering (when\nstubs change providers), multihoming, mobility, and traffic engineering.\nSolutions to these challenges are based on the use of multiaddressing,\nname based sockets, a LIMA concept of address dismemberment, transport\nprotocols such as SCTP that are capable of dynamic address\nreconfiguration, and new management-plane and control-plane procedures.\nPreliminary RIB data analysis quantify the benefit of LIMA in global\nrouting table size reduction (to 6815 entries from today?s 335K entries),\nand a cost of LIMA in terms of number of provider changes made by stubs in\nthe last six months (about 2450 provider changes per month across 33K\nstubs).\n\n******************\nBiography:\n\nMalathi Veeraraghavan is a Professor in the Charles L.

Because the heterogeneity arises\nfrom different factors, we need to pursue multiple research directions in\nparallel to generate a comprehensive understanding of breast cancer. To\ndissect inter-tumor (population) heterogeneity, we profiled 2,000 breast\ntumors using both DNA and RNA microarrays, where new subtypes were\ndiscovered to account for the additional heterogeneity revealed in the\ncurrent stratification schemes. Since these new subtypes imply both\nprognosis and functional differences, we dissected their regulatory\nheterogeneity to uncover the subtype-specific driving mechanisms, and\nperformed functional validation of putative drivers in vitro. Finally,\nimage processing techniques can be combined with molecular data mining to\ndissect intra-tumor (cellular) heterogeneity, which leads to the discovery\nof a new prognostic factor in the tumor microenvironment.

Unfortunately, multithreading remains\nhazardous, rife with problems such as data races, atomicity violations,\nand deadlocks. These problems are all related to threads interfering with\neach other. However, programmers must sift through potential interference\npoints to look for actual interference - a tedious task prone to mistakes.\nWe propose to document all actual interference points using yield\nannotations, ensuring a correctness property called cooperability. By\nensuring cooperability, the accidental complexity of identifying actual\ninterference points is eliminated, sequential reasoning is correct by\ndefault, and programs run at the same speed as before. We demonstrate\nprogram analysis techniques that work either at run-time or compile-time\nto ensure that actual interference points are documented with a yield\nannotation. The number of actual interference points is quite low, and so\nyield annotations remain succinct. In our benchmark set, we show that only\n13 yield annotations are necessary per thousand lines of code.\n\n\n*******************\nBiography:\n\nDr. Jaeheon YI is a researcher in programming languages and concurrency. \nHis research aims to make shared-memory multithreading easier for \nprogrammers, by making thread interleavings more explicit with yield \nannotations.

These include mode ms, home gateways, and DSL Access\nMultiplexers (DSLAMs), and are responsible for 70-80% of total\nnetwork-based energy consumption. On the user side of access networks, the\npresence of continuous light traffic condemns gateways to being powered\nmost of the time despite having Sleep-on-Idle (SoI) capabilities. To\naddress this, we introduce Broadband Hitch-Hiking (BH^2), that takes\nadvantage of the overlap of wireless networks to aggregate user traffic in\nas few gateways as possible. In current urban settings BH^2 can power off\n65-90% of gateways. Powering off gateways permits the remaining ones to\nsynchronize at higher speeds due to reduced crosstalk from having fewer\nactive lines. On the ISP side, we propose introducing simple inexpensive\nswitches at the distribution frame for batching active lines to a subset\nof cards letting the remaining ones sleep. Overall, our results show an\n80% energy savings margin in access networks. The combination of BH^2 and\nswitching gets close to this margin, saving 66% on average.\n\nSecond, I will focus on backbone and datacenter networks. Their energy\nconsumption is a problem because, despite being smaller than for access\nnetworks, it is already sufficiently large to threaten to shortly hit the\npower delivery limits while the hardware is trying to sustain\never-increasing traffic requirements. Unfortunately, existing approaches\nthat recompute the optimal network configuration with each substantial\nchange in traffic demand do not scale. To overcome the\noptimality-scalability trade-off, I introduce REsPoNse, an approach that\nprecomputes a few energy-critical paths and uses online traffic\nengineering to redirect the traffic in a way that enables large parts of\nthe network to enter a low-power state. Evaluation results with real\ntraces demonstrate that it achieves the same energy savings as the\nexisting approaches, with marginal impact on network scalability.\n\nReferences:\n- Insomnia in the Access or How to Curb Access Network Related Energy\nConsumption.

In this talk, we will discuss a novel model to consider the\ncharacter-word relation in topic modeling by placing an asymmetric prior\non the topic-word distribution of the standard Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n(LDA) model. Compared to LDA, this model can improve performance in\ndocument classification especially when test data contains considerable\nnumber of Chinese words not appeared in training data.\n\n\n********************\nBiography:\n\nDr. Zengchang Qin is an associate professor in Beihang University,\nBeijing, China.

These tiny distributed sensors provide discrete samples of\r\nenvironmental parameters, for example, temperature, humidity, gas\r\npressure, decibel levels, and etc. Since sensors are always constrained by\r\ntheir limited battery power, how to energy efficiently use a large number\r\nof distributed sensors and their samples in an application is of great\r\nimportance. In this thesis we have presented a series of intelligent\r\nsampling approaches. It is worthwhile to point out that sampling in sensor\r\nnetworks has many interesting properties. First, sensor sampling has two\r\ndimensions. The temporal dimension decides how many samples a sensor\r\nshould obtain. In our sampling approaches, the temporal sampling is used\r\nto adjust the sensor sampling rates and provide required data quality\r\nunder the noisy environment. The spatial dimension distributely selects a\r\nsubset of sensors to save the sampling and transmission cost. We also find\r\nthat sensor sampling is application dependent. Different applications\r\n(e.g. different queries, data cleaning, pattern search) usually require\r\ndifferent approaches to optimally use the samples and sensors. Even\r\ndifferent scenarios of an application (e.g. in a pattern search\r\napplication, the sensory data may have or have no spatial similarity)\r\naffect the design of a sampling approach. This thesis includes three main\r\nparts: (1) intelligent sampling for sum and range queries, (2) intelligent\r\nsampling for a data cleaning application, and (3) intelligent sampling for\r\nsome specific sensor applications, such as pattern query over distributed\r\nsensory streams and max regional aggregate query. Our extensive simulation\r\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed\r\nsampling approaches in different applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 3 June 2008\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t9:30a.m.-11:30a.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3416\r\n\t\t\tLifts 17-18\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Howard Luong (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Lei Chen (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\tProf. Vincent Shen\r\n\t\t\tProf. Ke Yi\r\n\t\t\tProf. Xiangru Zhang (CIVL)\r\n\t\t\tProf. Jeffrey Yu (Sys.

To manage changes, object design patterns\r\nhave been widely deployed. Despite their popularity, there are competing\r\nforces behind deploying them. For example, design patterns are claimed to\r\nreduce coupling and increase flexibility, but they are also criticized to\r\nintroduce additional indirections, complicating the software to complete\r\nchanges. This leads us to pursue our general research question: To face\r\nwith an anticipated change in software development, is it worthwhile to\r\ndeploy design patterns in advance? This question is challenged because the\r\nanswer depends on whether deploying design patterns in advance facilitates\r\nmaintainers to complete an anticipated change, yet the maintainers'\r\nperformance is also influenced by experience and skill.\r\n\r\nWe empirically investigate this question in two phases. In the first\r\nphase, we aim to investigate how likely the maintainers will utilize the\r\ndeployed design patterns. We have conducted a study of maintainers\r\ncompleting different kinds of changes on different pattern-deployed\r\nprograms. As an important finding, our result show that the utilization\r\nrate of deployed design patterns can be 100%. In average cases, that rate\r\nin correct programs is significantly higher than that in faulty programs.\r\nThis suggests that those maintainers who successfully completed changes\r\ntend to utilize deployed design patterns.\r\n\r\nWhile only pattern-deployed programs were studied in the first phase, we\r\nalso studied software without design patterns deployed for an anticipated\r\nchange in the second phase. We studied two finer questions. First, to\r\ncorrectly complete an anticipated change, is deploying design patterns in\r\nadvance lead to faster maintenance than not? If so, would this factor be\r\nmore dominant than maintainers\u2019 experience and skills to guide\r\nmaintainers to complete the change? In our controlled experiment, we\r\nreplicated the realization of three perfective changes on two\r\nfunctionally-the-same programs, with and without design patterns to\r\nfacilitate the changes. We also compare maintainers with and without\r\nexperience on the working program and good skills on programming language\r\nused. Interestingly, we find that the time spent by the inexperienced and\r\nnon-skillful maintainers who work on the pattern-deployed program is much\r\nshorter than that of the experienced and skillful maintainers on the\r\nalternative program. Altogether, our results support that in terms of the\r\noverall performance of maintainers to correctly complete a change,\r\ndeploying design patterns in advance is beneficial despite the negative\r\nforces. The main contributions of our results lie in uncovering deeper\r\ninsights about the effects of deploying design patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tThursday, 31 January 2008\r\n\r\nTime:                   11:00a.m.-1:00p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 4475\r\n\t\t\tlifts 25-26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Shing-Chi Cheung (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\tDr. Lei Chen (Chairperson)\r\n                        Dr. Zonghua Gu\r\n\t\t\tProf. Frederick Lochovsky\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["The Effects of Deploying Design Patterns for Software Changes"], "lenArticle": 449},

As XML has become a defacto standard for exchanging Web data, an\ninteresting and practical research problem is the development of models\nand techniques to satisfy various needs and preferences in searching XML\ndata.\n\nIn this thesis, we employ a list of simple XML tagged keywords as a\nvehicle for searching XML fragments in a collection of XML documents. In\norder to deal with the diversified nature of XML documents as well as user\npreferences, we propose a novel Multi-Ranker Model (MRM), which is able to\nabstract a spectrum of important XML properties and adapt the features to\ndifferent XML search needs.\n\nThe MRM is composed of three ranking levels. The lowest level consists of\ntwo categories of similarity and granularity features. At the intermediate\nlevel, we define four tailored XML Rankers (XRs), which consist of\ndifferent lower level features and have different strengths in searching\nXML fragments. The XRs are trained via a learning mechanism called the\nRanking Support Vector Machine in a voting Spy Na\u00efve Bayes Framework\n(RSSF). The RSSF takes as input a set of labeled fragments and feature\nvectors and generates as output Adaptive Rankers (ARs) in the learning\nprocess. The ARs are defined over the XRs and generated at the top level\nof the MRM.\n\nWe show empirically that the RSSF is able to improve the MRM significantly\nin the learning process that needs only a small set of training XML\nfragments. We demonstrate that the trained MRM is able to bring out the\nstrengths of the XRs in order to adapt different preferences and queries.\n\nWe also present the Adaptive Information Merging Approach (AIM) to merge\nthe XML fragments returned from the ranked result list. We incorporate the\nusers' feedbacks in order to further improve the coverage and specificity\nof the merged results, which are measured in terms of two formal notions\nof Information Completeness (IC) and Data Complexity (DC). IC represents\nsource coverage and computes the \"completeness\" of those involved\ninformation sources and DC represents \"richness\" of data and computes the\ncomplexity of the retrieved data items.\n\n\nDate:                   Friday, 5 October 2007\n\nTime:                   2:00p.m.-4:00p.m.\n\nVenue:                  Room 3301\n                        Lifts 17-18\n\nChairman:               Prof. Kani Chen (MATH)\n\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Wilfred Ng (Supervisor)\n                        Prof. Frederick Lochovsky\n                        Prof. Vincent Shen\n                        Prof. Andrew Lim (IELM)\n                        Prof. Jeffrey Xu Yu (Sys.Engg. & Engg.Mgmt.,CUHK)\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["An Adaptive Framework for Searching XML Documents"], "lenArticle": 455},

As a \r\nconsequence, the distance between any two uncertain objects becomes a \r\nrandom variable rather than a fixed value, and thus the existing \r\ntechniques proposed for answering queries on precise data points cannot be \r\ndirectly applied to the uncertain scenario.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we investigate probabilistic queries on both static and \r\ndynamically moving uncertain objects. In particular, queries in static \r\nuncertain databases include probabilistic group nearest neighbor (PGNN), \r\nprobabilistic reverse nearest neighbor (PRNN), and probabilistic reverse \r\nskyline (PRSQ) queries, whereas that in uncertain moving object databases \r\nincludes the probabilistic consistent k-nearest neighbor (con-kNN) query. \r\nDue to the intrinsic differences between uncertain and certain data, we \r\nformally re-define these query types in uncertain databases, which \r\nprovides the confidence guarantee of the query answers. Most importantly, \r\nto tackle the efficiency problem of query processing, we propose effective \r\npruning methods to facilitate reducing the search space for each query \r\ntype, and seamlessly integrate them into an efficient query procedure. We \r\nalso formulate and tackle some useful and important variants of these \r\nquery types.

It is inspired by human learning activities in that people often \r\napply the knowledge gained from previous learning tasks to help learn a new \r\ntask. Over the past decade, this learning approach has attracted the attention \r\nof many researchers, making it a hot research topic in the machine learning \r\ncommunity. In this survey, we review some major recent development in multitask \r\nlearning. We categorize multitask learning methods into four main classes, \r\nnamely, the common representation approach which seeks to find a common data or \r\nmodel representation for multiple tasks, the task regularization approach which \r\nformulates multitask learning under a regularization framework and represents \r\nthe model assumption as a regularization term in the objective function, the \r\ntask clustering approach which clusters the tasks and assumes that a common or \r\nsimilar representation is shared among the tasks within the same cluster, and \r\nthe hierarchical Bayesian approach which is based on hierarchical Bayesian \r\nmodeling in Bayesian statistics. Moreover, we discuss the advantages and \r\ndisadvantages of these four approaches, hoping to provide some guidance on \r\nselecting the appropriate approach given a target application at hand. Besides \r\nmultitask learning, there also exist other approaches to boosting learning \r\nperformance in situations when labeled training data are scarce, such as \r\nsemi-supervised learning and active learning. Along this line, we introduce \r\nsome work that combines multitask learning with these approaches to achieve \r\nfurther improvement in performance. After reviewing the different approaches, \r\nwe briefly present some theoretical results that provide theoretical \r\njustifications on the benefit of multitask learning.

As the emerging technology, \r\nwireless sensor networks (WSNs) are well known for its feature of easy \r\ndeployment, low cost and etc. Since most of the commercial WSNs-oriented \r\nproducts using ISM 2.4GHz band for communications, the communication costs \r\nin terms of energy and time become a very challenging issue for real \r\napplications.

Traditionally, such mesh is constructed in a rather \r\nrandom ad-hoc manner, where peers connect to multiple parents through a \r\ngossip mechanism. Because stream delay is given by the longest path of the \r\npackets, the mesh constructed in this way is often of high delay. In this \r\nwork, we address how to design and optimize a low-delay mesh robust to \r\npeer churns, where each peer is served by some streaming and backup \r\nparents. We first formulate the mesh optimization problem to minimize \r\nworst-case user delay. The problem is shown to be NP-hard, and hence we \r\npropose a centralized heuristic which is applicable to small \r\ncentrally-controlled networks and serves as a benchmark. We then propose a \r\nnovel distributed algorithm called RMesh, which adapts to dynamic network \r\nby continuously reducing delay. Using simulation and real Internet \r\ntopology from PlanetLab, we show that RMesh indeed achieves low delay and \r\nis robust against node churns with high video continuity.

As more \r\nand more high-speed, lossy, long-delay and/or variable-delay links are widely \r\ndeployed in the Internet, traditional resource management schemes exhibit \r\nseveral shortcomings, such as poor utilization of the bottleneck link, unfair \r\nbandwidth allocation to different RTT flows, incorrect interpretation of \r\nbit-error packet loss as congestion, and slow responsiveness to fast-changing \r\nlink conditions of mobile nodes. To address these problems, we develop flexible \r\nand adaptive cross-layer schemes that optimize the performance (throughput, \r\nlatency, fairness, etc.) of the whole system. We propose Quick Flow Control \r\nProtocol (QFCP) as a router-assisted congestion control protocol for high \r\nbandwidth-delay product networks. It allows flows to start with high initial \r\nsending rates indicated by routers along the path and to converge to the \r\nfair-share sending rate quickly based on feedbacks from routers. We next extend \r\nQFCP to wireless networks so that it can distinguish bit-error loss from \r\ncongestion loss and probe the unknown bandwidth capacity of wireless links in \r\ncalculating the router feedback. Regarding to the unique characteristics of \r\nvehicular networks such as the high node mobility and unpredictable channel \r\nconditions, we propose an efficient model-tree-based rate adaptation scheme \r\ntermed MTRA that can predict the packet error rate (PER) and adapt the data \r\nrate in real time. We present a detailed methodology for the PER model tree \r\nbuilding and update.

In these problems, we have to preprocess the given point \r\nset in some space into a data structure according to the query type, so that \r\nqueries can be answered efficiently. So far in our research, we have obtained \r\nthe following three results.\r\n\r\nOur first two results concern approximate nearest neighbor searching in the \r\ncontext of metric spaces. We show that the concept of\u00a0approximate Voronoi \r\ndiagram (AVD), which is known to provide the most efficient solution in \r\nEuclidean spaces, can be generalized to doubling spaces as well as to \r\nhyperbolic spaces.

In practice,\r\nhowever, such requirements can not be satisfied in many applications, such\r\nas security and surveillance, intrusion detection, outdoor asset\r\nprotection, and location-aware applications. In this proposal, I propose a\r\nnew localization scheme called transceiver-free localization. The basic\r\nidea of transceiver-free localization is to utilize the change of wireless\r\nsignals of different wireless links to locate the target object. I prove\r\nthat the object detection behavior of each wireless link can be described\r\nby Signal Dynamic Model and T-R model. The former one is a deterministic\r\nmodel and the later one is a probabilistic model. T-R model presents many\r\nunique features and new requirements, calling a revisit for most of\r\ncoverage problems. Moreover, in order to serve different requirements, I\r\npropose five localization algorithms called Midpoint, Intersection,\r\nBest-cover, Dynamic Clustering and RASS.

Most commercial search engines return the \r\nsame set of results to all users who ask the same query. However, different \r\nusers may have different preferences on the result set. In this proposal, we \r\npresent an effective method to mine a user's conceptual preferences from search \r\nengine clickthrough data, and adjust the search result ranking according to the \r\nextracted preferences to improve the retrieval effectiveness for the user. Our \r\napproach employs an Ontology-based User Profile (OUP) that represents a user \r\nprofile as an ontology. We then derive an extended set of conceptual \r\npreferences based on the ontology and the user's clickthroughs. The user \r\nprofile is input to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to learn a concept \r\npreference vector for adapting a personalized ranking function to re-rank the \r\nsearch results. Our initial results show that the top-10 precision achieved by \r\nOUP is almost three times higher compared to the method without employing \r\npersonalization at all, and about 60% better than that of the hierarchical user \r\nprofile proposed by Xu et al. Moreover, our method can significantly improve \r\nthe users' average clicked ranks by about 65% compared to other methods that do \r\nnot employ concept ontology. Based on these results, we will further extend our \r\nresearch in the areas of community-based personalization and location-based \r\npersonalization.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:  \t\t\tThursday, 10 December 2009\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 1504\r\n \t\t\tlifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Dik-Lun Lee (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Wilfred Ng (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["CONCEPT-BASED PERSONALIZED WEB SEARCH"], "lenArticle": 281},

In this thesis, we present four methods for improving the \r\nintuitiveness and effectiveness of direct volume rendering as follows.\r\n\r\n1).

Determining the\r\ninstant link conditions (or qualities) is essential for most protocol\r\ndesigns and application developments in wireless communications.

Each peer in BitTorrent system \r\nplays two roles: server and client. This model decreases the server\u2019s \r\nburden a lot. However, free-rider, a peer just downloads without any \r\nupload contribution, has become one of the most serious problems in \r\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) system. Free-riders\u2019 behavior has influenced the system \r\nperform seriously. Some incentive mechanisms, like reputation system, have \r\nbeen proposed to deal with this problem, but it shows that they are not \r\ngood enough on preventing free-riders finishing downloading. The reason is \r\nthat those policies discover free-riders\u2019 behavior after or during the \r\nprocess of trading with free-riders, so it gives opportunities to \r\nfree-riders to download freely from other nodes. In this thesis, we \r\npropose a novel approach named PreDiscover to prevent the free-riding \r\nbehavior in BitTorrent file sharing system. In PreDiscover, regular peers \r\nand free-riders can be recognized before trading, which means a regular \r\npeer knows its neighbors are free-riders or not without sending any blocks \r\nto them, so it gives little opportunities for free-riders to get blocks \r\nfrom others freely. We implement PreDiscover in a simulator based on \r\nBitTorrent Protocol, and we compared the results of Original BitTorrent \r\nand PreDiscover.

Nevertheless, \r\nsuch deployment makes the well-known WLAN problems, such as hidden or \r\nexposed terminals, channel impairments such as multi-path fading, and so \r\non, more severe, resulting in several types of service provisioning \r\nproblem in WMNs. Among such problems that are yet to be addressed, we \r\nlist, fairness among MAC flows, and flow starvation, the ultimate \r\nmanifestation of the lack of fairness. In this thesis, we aim to design a \r\nframework, to address these problems and to enable additional services \r\nsuch as QoS Routing and admission control. We also aim our framework to be \r\neasily deployable in a real system.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, we first study the trade-off between aggregate MAC flow \r\nthroughput and the fairness in WMNs that utilize scheduling on top of the \r\nCSMA/CA access scheme. We propose an analytical model to study the \r\ninteraction between contending links with non-saturated nodes. Based on \r\nthis model, we formulate the bandwidth-scheduling problem as an aggregate \r\nMAC flow throughput maximization problem subject to the fairness \r\nrequirement dictated by the scheduler. The rational of such study is to \r\nprovide a theoretical benchmark to gage the performance of the plethora of \r\nnon work-conserving schedulers designed to run on top of the CSMA/CA \r\nprotocol in a distributed environment that have proliferated in recent \r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAfter understanding how much sacrifice in the aggregate MAC flow \r\nthroughput or the fairness are made - due to the mismatch between the \r\nobjective of the fair scheduler on one hand and the operation of the \r\nCSMA/CA algorithm on the other, we propose a distributed fair MAC flow \r\nallocation and scheduling framework for provisioning MAC flow fairness. \r\nThe framework consists of (1) a modified wireless ad hoc routing protocol \r\nto take into account bandwidth requirement, (2) a link information \r\ndissemination protocol to propagate local topology information, (3) a \r\ncooperative gradient-based iterative algorithm to allocate fairly MAC flow \r\nbandwidth and (4) a distributed fair MAC scheduler to coordinate access to \r\nthe channel according to the allocated bandwidth.

Internet routers play a\r\ncrucial role in sustaining this growth by being able to switch packets\r\nextremely fast to keep up with the growing bandwidth (line rate). This\r\ndemands using sophisticated packet switching and buffering techniques\r\nto be adopted in the router design. In particular, all routers rely on\r\nwell-designed packet buffers, with large capacity but with short\r\nresponse times for each packet, to deliver high throughput and deal\r\nwith temporary congestion. Current memory technologies like SRAM and\r\nDRAM cannot meet the two requirements (capacity and response time)\r\nsimultaneously. The SRAM is fast enough but it cannot be built with\r\nlarge capacity, and is power hungry. The DRAM can be built with a\r\nlarge capacity, but the access time is too large. This prompted some\r\nresearchers to suggest a combined SRAM/DRAM hierarchical buffer\r\narchitecture that achieves good throughput and latency with large\r\ncapacity. Interleaved and parallel buffers further improve upon the\r\nscalability. In all these approaches both the SRAM and DRAM need to\r\nmaintain a large number of queues. In practice, maintaining so many\r\ndynamic queues is a real challenge and limits the buffer scalability\r\nof these centralized approaches.\r\n\r\nIn this survey, we review previous works and seek more efficient and\r\nnovel ways of achieving scalability by introducing a distributed\r\npacket buffer architecture. This new strategy raises two fundamental\r\nissues: (a) how to design scalable packet buffers using independent\r\nbuffer subsystems; and (b) how to dynamically balance the workload\r\namong multiple subsystems without any blocking. We address these\r\nissues by first designing a basic framework which allows flows\r\ndynamically switch from one subsystem to another without any blocking.\r\nIn particular, this framework defines a series of states that all\r\nflows must follow. It minimizes the overhead of state maintenance and\r\navoids DRAM fractions. Based on this framework, we further devise a\r\nload-balancing algorithm to meet the overall system requirements. Both\r\ntheoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our\r\nload-balancing algorithm and its corresponding memory hierarchy\r\noutperform the others when we have a high bandwidth links with large\r\nnumber of active connections (e.g., high-speed Internet).\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tFriday, 29 January 2010\r\n\r\nTime:                   4:00pm - 6:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3494\r\n \t\t\tlifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Mounir Hamdi (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lin Gu (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Yunhao Liu\r\n \t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Designing packet buffers in high-bandwidth switches and routers"], "lenArticle": 413},

To solve this \r\nproblem, Cognitive Radio (CR) is proposed to improve spectrum utility without \r\ninterference to licensed users.

In this proposal we focus on two important issues in CR networks: \r\nspectrum sensing and multi-user cooperation. i) Spectrum sensing is the key \r\ncomponent of CR technology. We improve spectrum sensing by studying spectrum \r\nusage prediction and cooperative spectrum sensing. Spectrum usage prediction \r\ncan significantly reduce the sensing range basing on history information. We \r\nconduct a large scale empirical study basing on realworld measurement to reveal \r\nthe predictability and ideal predictors for spectrum usage.

Geometry applications such as skeleton\nextraction, texture mapping, morphine, shape retrieval, matching, and\nmodeling, often involve segmentation as an initial step. However, automatic\ndecomposition of a mesh into meaningful components that match human\nintuition is a hard problem, as it is difficult to define a measure that\ncaptures the semantic information of a given shape.\n\nAccording to the state-of-the-art benchmark on automatic mesh\nsegmentation algorithms, a recent randomized cut technique produces\nsegmentation results that are more consistent with human-generated\nsegmentations than other recent methods. Their method iteratively splits\nthe object by randomly finding a large set of possible cuts and\nselecting the one with the best boundary. However, since a large set\nof possible cuts are considered for each split, there is a tradeoff\nbetween quality and computation cost, requiring several minutes to\nprocess a single model.\n\nIn this thesis, we propose an automatic segmentation method based on\nrandomized isolines on 3D mesh surfaces. The isolines are\niso-contours sampled from the segmentation fields associated with\ncritical points located at prominent extremities of the model.  The\nsegmentation fields are obtained by solving constrained Laplacian\nsystems using a novel weighting scheme which we call the inverse\nGaussian weighting scheme. The resulting fields have the desirable\nproperty of exhibiting large variation at concave regions while\nbeing mostly constant on convex and flat regions. Consequently, the\nuniformly sampled isolines are much denser at concave regions,\ncoinciding with where humans are likely to segment the model.

These providers are untrustworthy\nand may possibly tamper with the results. Authenticated\nquery processing enables the clients to verify that the results\nindeed originate from the data owner (authenticity), and\ninclude all data satisfying the query (completeness). The\nmost popular database outsourcing model requires that the data\nowner and the service provider construct identical copies of an\nauthenticated data structure (ADS) on the outsourced data.\nThe ADS is cryptographically signed by the owner. The service\nprovider uses the ADS to answer the queries and generate a\nverification object, which includes cryptographic\ninformation for establishing the authenticity and completeness of\nthe results.\n\nIn this thesis we present methods for authenticated query\nprocessing in several challenging scenarios. Initially, we devise\nefficient solutions for authentication on relational data\nstreams, where the highly dynamic nature of the data motivates\nthe need for efficient continuous query processing, fast ADS\nupdating, and provision for temporal completeness that\nallows the clients to verify that there are no missing results in\nbetween updates.

For dealing \r\nwith above issues, I develop theoretical principles and de-sign practical \r\nalgorithms. Especially, I focus on the localization issue of the passive RFID \r\nsystem. Since passive tags are widely used in many applications, for example, \r\nsupply chain, food industry, warehouse management, and transportation and \r\nlogistics. In such applications, the location information of tags is extremely \r\ncritical. However, the uncertain properties of Received Signal Strength \r\nIndicators (RSSI), various backscattering on different power levels and \r\ndirectional reading of readers make traditional ranging-based approaches not \r\nwork well in passive RFID system scenarios. Although absolute positions are \r\ndifficult to obtain, we can estimate locations by building a relative \r\nrelationship between tags. To reduce the effect of above limitations, I propose \r\na range-free approach named LPT to establish a relative graph. Through \r\nimplementations in real RFID systems, I evaluate my approaches and compare them \r\nwith previous works. The results show the effectiveness and accuracy of my \r\nmethods. The proposed approaches can be further applied to other application \r\nscenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 23 March 2010\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:00am \u2013 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3301A\r\n \t\t\tLifts 17/18\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Philip Mok (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Lionel Ni (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung\r\n                    \tProf. Yunhao Liu\r\n                         Prof. Guohua Chen (CBME)\r\n                         Prof. Jian-nong Cao (Comp., PolyU)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Localization and Tracking Based on RFID Technologies"], "lenArticle": 330},

For example, wireless sensor networks \r\nintend to provide information on spatio-temporal characteristics of the \r\nobserved physical world. It is necessary to associate sensed data with \r\nlocations, making data geographically meaningful. Besides, location \r\ninformation also supports fundamental network functions, such as topology \r\ncontrol, routing, clustering, and so on. Hence, localization, a mechanism \r\nfor autonomously discovering and establishing spatial relationships among \r\nsensor nodes, is of great importance in the design and development of \r\nwireless ad-hoc and sensor networks.\r\n\r\nThis proposal mainly addresses the network and node localizability, which \r\nattract many research efforts in recent years. Network localizability is \r\nto answer whether or not a network can be localized; i.e., the locations \r\nof all network nodes can be uniquely determined under the constraints of \r\ninter-node distances and beacon locations. Nevertheless, we observe from \r\nworking systems that the networks are not always entirely localizable. In \r\nour research, we propose the concept of node localizability that focuses \r\non the location uniqueness of a single node. Indeed, network \r\nlocalizability is a special case of node localizability in which all nodes \r\nare localizable. Applying rigidity theory, we study the conditions of a \r\nnode being localizable and achieve so far the best result of identifying \r\nlocalizable nodes. For the first time, it is possible to analyze how many \r\nnodes one can expected to locate in sparsely or moderately connected \r\nnetworks.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:  \t\t\tTuesday, 30 March 2010\r\n\r\nTime:           \t10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:          \tRoom 3494\r\n \t\t\tlifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Yunhao Liu (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tProf. Lionel Ni\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["On the Localizability of Wireless Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks"], "lenArticle": 303},

These concurrency bugs give rise to the problem of \r\ndata-consistency errors, which can lead to drastic consequences (e.g., the \r\nNortheast Blackout of 2003). However, detecting concurrency bugs is difficult \r\nbecause these bugs are manifested only under very specific thread interleavings \r\nbut the number of possible interleavings for a multithreaded program is often \r\nmyriad.\r\n\r\nThis proposal presents program analysis techniques to automatically verify that \r\na multithreaded program correctly uses synchronization primitives to guarantee \r\natomic-set serializability, a data-consistency criterion recently proposed for \r\nbetter detection of concurrency bugs. Atomic-set serializability characterizes \r\na wide range of concurrency bugs. In addition, previous experiences using this \r\ncriterion show that it is less likely to have benign violations than the other \r\ncriteria. This proposal addresses the following two problems on detecting \r\natomic-set serializability violations: inadequate interleaving coverage and \r\ninadequate input coverage.\r\n\r\nFirst, dynamic approaches are widely used to detect errors (e.g., malign data \r\nrace) caused by concurrency bugs. Existing dynamic approaches for detecting \r\nsuch violations are based on runtime monitoring. Their effectiveness is \r\nrestricted by the inadequate coverage of interleavings. To address this \r\nproblem, this proposal presents a dynamic testing technique that uses \r\ninformation from profiled runs to control a thread scheduler to focus on \r\ninterleavings that have high potential for exhibiting such violations.\r\n\r\nSecond, for a given set of tests, our testing technique partially alleviates \r\nthe problem of inadequate coverage of thread interleaving. However, the input \r\ncoverage of our testing technique is restricted to that of the given tests. To \r\naddress this problem, this proposal presents a static checking technique to \r\nautomatically detect atomic-set serializability violations. Existing static \r\napproaches for detecting such violations use path-sensitive analyses, which are \r\nusually not scalable for large programs. To address the scalability issue, this \r\nproposal presents a series of flow-insensitive analyses to detect such \r\nviolations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:  \t\t\tThursday, 15 April 2010\r\n\r\nTime:           \t10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:          \tRoom 3401\r\n \t\t\tlifts 17/18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Shing-Chi Cheung (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Charles Zhang (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala\r\n \t\t\tDr. Sunghun Kim\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Effective Detection of Atomic-Set Serializability Violations in Multithreaded Programs"], "lenArticle": 377},

However, in many real-world applications, this\r\nassumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification\r\ntask in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data\r\nin another domain, where the latter data may be in a different feature\r\nspace or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge\r\ntransfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of\r\nlearning by avoiding much expensive data labeling efforts. In recent\r\nyears, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning setting to address\r\nthis problem. In this proposal, we propose a novel dimensionality\r\nreduction framework for transfer learning. Our dimensionality reduction\r\nframework tries to learn a subspace across domains in a Reproducing Kernel\r\nHilbert Space (RKHS) using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). In the\r\nsubspace, distance between data distributions can be close to each other.\r\nAs a result, with the new representations in this subspace, we can apply\r\nstandard machine learning methods to train classifiers or regression\r\nmodels in the source domain for use in the target domain. Based on the\r\nframework, we first present two unsupervised dimensionality reduction\r\nmethods,  Maximum Mean Discrepancy Embedding (MMDE) and Transfer Component\r\nAnalysis (TCA), for transfer learning. The effectiveness of MMDE and TCA\r\nhas been verified by experiments on two real-world applications:\r\ncross-domain indoor WiFi localization and cross-domain text\r\nclassification. We further propose a semi-supervised extension of TCA\r\n(SSTCA), which not only reduces distance between domains but also\r\nmaximizes dependence between features and labels when learning the\r\nsubspace in a RKHS based on an integration of the MMD and Hilbert-Schmidt\r\nIndependence Criterion (HSIC) techniques. Preliminary experiments show\r\nthat the proposed SSTCA method for transfer learning is promising.

However, it is not uncommon for some real-world data, \r\nsuch as web pages and research papers, to contain relations (links) between the \r\ninstances. Different instances in such data are correlated (linked) with each \r\nother, which implies that the common i.i.d. assumption is unreasonable for such \r\nrelational data. Hence, naively applying traditional statistical learning \r\nmethods to relational data may lead to misleading conclusion about the data.\r\n\r\nBecause relational data widely exist in a large variety of application areas, \r\nsuch as web mining, social network analysis, bioinformatics, and marketing, \r\nrecently many researchers have started to propose novel methods, called \r\nstatistical relational learning (SRL) methods, to model relational data. The \r\nexisting mainstream SRL models extend traditional graphical models, such as \r\nBayesian networks and Markov networks, by eliminating their underlying i.i.d. \r\nassumption. Some typical examples of such SRL models include relational \r\nBayesian networks, relational Markov networks, and Markov logic networks. \r\nBecause the dependency structure in relational data is typically very complex, \r\nstructure learning for these relational graphical models is often very \r\ntime-consuming or even impossible. Hence, it might be impractical to apply \r\nthese models to large-scale relational data sets.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, we propose a new SRL framework, called relational factor \r\nmodeling, by extending traditional latent variable modeling and factor analysis \r\nto relational domains. Based on our framework, a series of novel SRL models, \r\ncalled relational factor models (RFMs), are proposed for SRL. One promising \r\nadvantage of our RFMs is that there is no need for the time-consuming structure \r\nlearning at all and the time complexity of most of them is linear to the number \r\nof observed links in the data. This implies that our RFMs can be used to model \r\nlarge-scale data sets.

Nearest neighbor and range searching are among \r\nthe most fundamental problems in computational geometry, with numerous \r\napplications in areas such as pattern recognition, machine learning, and \r\ninformation retrieval.

To ease \r\ndebugging, researchers have proposed various dynamic analysis techniques that \r\naid developers in locating the program defects based on passed and failed test \r\nruns. In this proposal, we study a prevalent type of defects called code \r\nomission faults, which involve missing code and cannot be ascribed to any \r\nprogram entity that exists in the program. Code omission faults pose two major \r\nchallenges to existing dynamic analysis techniques. First, missing code offers \r\nno execution behavior to observe directly. Second, even when the place of \r\nomission could have been accurately pinpointed, it is still difficult for \r\ndevelopers to conjecture the missing code.\r\n\r\nTo address these challenges of code omission, we conducted an empirical study \r\nto characterize real-world omission faults. Among 4966 non-trivial bug fixes \r\nextracted from a large open source project GNU/GCC, we found that 57% of them \r\ncorrespond to omission faults, which can be further categorized into 11 \r\nsub-types. Among them, we discovered that some sub-types, such as \r\nmissing-assignment or missing-return, often induce certain dynamic control \r\nflows and data flows patterns when they trigger program failures. We express \r\nthese patterns in an event flow language and show that by matching them against \r\nprogram execution, it is possible to accurately locate these sub-types of \r\nomission faults and infer part of their missing code. The remaining sub-types \r\nof omission faults, such as missing-condition and missing-branch, are more \r\ncomplex and induce patterns that vary with the missing code, which is mostly \r\nunknown at the time of debugging. For these complex omission faults, we \r\nempirically observed that the missing code likely appear elsewhere in a similar \r\nor even the same form. Inspired by this observation, we propose an approach \r\nthat systematically removes different parts of the program and infers \r\ncontrol-flow and data-flow patterns that are associated with these pieces of \r\nartificially removed code. We show that these patterns are useful to the \r\nlocalization of complex omission faults. We evaluate our approach using real \r\nworld omission faults and mutation analysis on five real world programs: gcc, \r\nspace, grep, and bc.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:  \t\t\tWednesday, 12 May 2010\r\n\r\nTime:           \t10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:          \tRoom 4480\r\n \t\t\tlifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Shing-Chi Cheung (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Sunghun Kim (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lin Gu\r\n \t\t\tDr. Charles Zhang\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Automatic Localization of Code Omission Faults: a Context Pattern based Approach"], "lenArticle": 401},

In practice, \r\nhowever, such requirements can not be satisfied in many applications, such \r\nas security and surveillance, intrusion detection, outdoor asset \r\nprotection, and location-aware applications. In this dissertation, I \r\npropose a new localization scheme called transceiver-free localization. \r\nThe basic idea of transceiver-free localization is to utilize the change \r\nof wireless signals of different wireless links to locate the target \r\nobject. I prove that the object detection behavior of each wireless link \r\ncan be described by two models.

The former 3 \r\nalgorithms are based on centralized environment. Dynamic Clustering and \r\nRASS are able to locate multiple objects. I prove that RASS guaranteed \r\ntracking accuracy is bounded by only about 0.26s without sacrificing the \r\naccuracy and scalability. Experimental results show that these algorithms \r\ncan have remarkable high accuracy up to 0.85m. At Last, our \r\ntransceiver-free localization approaches can also be utilized to improve \r\nthe accuracy of traditional transceiver-based approaches.

The first concerns how to come up with reasonable \r\nconjectures automatically. This raises further challenges, such as how to \r\nrepresent these conjectures within the computers, what is the yardstick \r\nfor reasonableness, etc. The second concerns how to prove or negate the \r\nconjectures automatically. However theorem proving, even for the best of \r\nhuman beings, is still an intelligence-demanding endeavor and sometimes \r\neven a nightmare.\r\n\r\nOur starting point however, is a basic form of proof, namely proof by \r\ninduction. The heuristic behind is extremely straightforward: We first \r\nformulate the problem domain in a proper language, say logic or other \r\nformal languages. We then enumerate the sentences (within certain length \r\nlimit) in the underlying language that describe propositions in the \r\ndomain. After that, we use a computer program to verify through these \r\nsentences to find those true in base cases, that is, where the problem \r\nsize is small. The remaining sentences serves as conjectures, which can be \r\nextended, one way or other, to inductive cases.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that this methodology has been quite effective since we \r\nadopted it in economic theory. In particular, some of our programs on game \r\ntheory have returned theorems that shed lights on the understanding of \r\nbasic game forms such as zero-sum game, potential game and super-modular \r\ngame. Some of them have helped us prove some Nobel Prize winning theorems \r\nsuch as Arrow's impossibility theorem and Sen's theorem on voting \r\nfunctions and discover new theorems that better characterize key concepts \r\nin social choice theory.

To\r\nfacilitate clinical assessment of blood vessels, there is a growing need\r\nof developing automated vessel segmentation schemes based on magnetic\r\nresonance angiographic (MRA) images. A vast number of approaches have been\r\nproposed in the past decade for the segmentation of vascular structures in\r\nMRA images. These approaches were devised according to different\r\nassumptions on the shape of blood vessels and different underlying prior\r\nknowledge about the desired imaging modalities. The development of these\r\napproaches aims at delivering more accurate and robust segmentation\r\nresults. Nonetheless, these approaches face different technical challenges\r\nthat prohibit them from being widely employed in the clinical environment.\r\nThe challenges include significant contrast variation of vessel boundaries\r\nin MRA images, the excessive computation time required by some algorithms\r\nand the complicated geometry of vascular structures. These challenges\r\nmotivate us to propose three novel edge detection and vascular\r\nsegmentation methods.\r\n\r\nIn the first proposed method, vessel segmentation is performed grounded on\r\nthe edge detection responses given by the weighted local variance-based\r\nedge detector. This detector is robust against large intensity contrast\r\nchanges and capable of returning accurate detection responses on low\r\ncontrast edges. Our second method is an efficient implementation of a well\r\nfounded vessel detection approach. The proposed efficient implementation\r\nis a thousand times faster than the conventional implementation without\r\nsegmentation performance deterioration. The third method is a curvilinear\r\nstructure descriptor which is robust against the disturbance induced by\r\nclosely located objects. Preliminary experimental results show that the\r\nproposed methods are very suitable for vascular segmentation in MRA\r\nimages.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:  \t\t\tTuesday, 18 May 2010\r\n\r\nTime:           \t2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:          \tRoom 3494\r\n \t\t\tlifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Albert Chung (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Chiew-Lan Tai (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Huamin Qu\r\n \t\t\tDr. Pedro Sander\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Vascular segmentation in magnetic resonance angiography"], "lenArticle": 323},

The simplest\u00a0and most intuitive memory \r\nmodel is sequential consistency (SC), which is largely an interleaved semantics \r\nin the program order of each thread, requiring\u00a0that a read returns the value \r\nwritten by the most recent write.

It\r\ncan simply and mathematically be defined as a set of samples (points)\r\nin a certain distance space such that every pair of samples are at\r\nleast certain distance away from each other. Poisson disk sampling is\r\nby far the sampling which achieves the combined objective of acquiring\r\nthe highest quality in visual appearance and producing the least\r\nspectral artifacts in the spectral domain. Henceforth, it is favored\r\nby ray tracing, which wants least artifacts when using a small number\r\nof ray samples, by stippling, which requires a uniform distribution of\r\ndrawing metaphors to represent gray scale smoothly without any\r\nnoticeable structure, by surface remeshing for its random and uniform\r\nresultant vertex positions, and by many other applications which ask\r\nfor a plausible uniform distribution of objects in any distance space.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, I present my three works on Poisson disk sampling,\r\neach of which addresses certain problems in a more specific context:\r\nPoisson disk sampling on surface by using dual tiling, the\r\nacceleration of capacity constrained Voronoi tessellation and\r\nanisotropic Poisson disk sampling in Riemannian distance space.

Today's cars have increasingly sophisticated \r\nin-vehicle electronic control systems with multiple ECUs (Electronic Controller \r\nUnits) inter-connected via multiple networking protocols, including FlexRay, \r\nCAN and TTP. Development of such real-time distributed systems is very \r\nchallenging due to complex and heterogeneous HW platforms, increasing \r\napplication complexity, and increasing concurrency in both application and HW \r\nplatform. Design Space Exploration (DSE) is the process of searching through \r\nthe vast design space to find a solution that satisfies certain design \r\nconstraints and/or optimizes certain design objectives. DSE has been advocated \r\nas an effective approach to dealing with the design problem of such complex \r\nembedded systems.\r\n\r\nThe DSE problem generally considers two orthogonal issues: 1. how can a single \r\ndesign point be evaluated, 2. how can the design space be covered during the \r\nexploration process? The search problem is typically a NP-hard problem, and \r\nexhaustive exploration of the design space is usually prohibitive due to the \r\nsheer size of the design space. In this thesis, we target on TTP-based \r\ndistributed real-time embedded systems and present efficient techniques for \r\ndesign space exploration and optimization of these systems, including exact \r\nsolution techniques (e.g., model-checking, SAT, SMT), stochastic techniques \r\n(e.g., simulated annealing, evolutionary algorithms), and hierarchical \r\nintegration of several search techniques (e.g., LBBD-based optimization \r\nframework). Due to the similarity between TTP and FlexRay (de-facto standard \r\nprotocol for in-vehicle communication), the proposed techniques can potentially \r\napplied to the optimization of FlexRay-based distributed systems (i.e., static \r\nsegment of FlexRay protocol).\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Response Time (WCRT) analysis is a widely-used schedulability \r\nanalysis technique for fixed-priority scheduling and other scheduling \r\nalgorithms such as Earliest Deadline First (EDF), which is often used as \r\ntechniques for evaluating a single design point regarding to real-time \r\nproperties. The transaction-based task model is an effective modeling approach \r\nespecially useful for schedulability analysis in distributed real-time systems. \r\nWe present effective techniques for improving the computation efficiency for \r\nexact and tractable WCRT analysis for transaction-based task model, where both \r\nFPS and EDF are considered as the processor scheduling strategies.\r\n\r\nExtensive experiments prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed \r\nalgorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 25 May 2010\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3311\r\n \t\t\tLifts 17/18\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Guanghao Chen (CIVL)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Jogesh Muppala (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung\r\n \t\t\tProf. Frederick Lochovsky\r\n \t\t\tProf. Charles Zhang\r\n                         Prof. Chi-Ying Tsui (ECE)\r\n                         Prof. Albert Cheng (Comp.

There are also many hybrid systems which can combine \r\nrecommender algorithms using stacking technique. However, most of them focus on \r\ncombining algorithms based on explicit feedback datasets, which are not always \r\navailable.

So how to combine implicit \r\nrecommender algorithms becomes a hot topic. Collaborative Filtering (CF), a \r\ncentral methodology in recommender systems, makes predictions of unknown \r\npreferences for a particular user based on other users? preferences. In this \r\nthesis, our work focuses on combining implicit CF algorithms by stacking \r\nframework. The procedures are arranged as follows.

Presently, researchers focus on studying how to make \r\nuse of more powerful modeling techniques to improve the forecasting \r\naccuracies, relatively few researchers consider the essence of correct \r\nfeatures selection (effective factors identification).\r\n\r\nIn the financial market, whether the stock price is going up or going down \r\nis mainly driven by the expectation of investors and speculators. The \r\ncorrect problem formulation achieved by considering effective factors is \r\nsuperior to making improvement on model complexities. In the real \r\nfinancial world, most of the investment decisions are relying on textual \r\ninformation (for instance, news articles) and human perceptions (trends of \r\nstock price) to predict market price movement. Most of these features, \r\nespecially textual information, are unstructured and fuzzy in nature, \r\nunable to be readily processed in computational models and this also \r\nremains lots of technical challenges in the literature. In this thesis \r\npaper, we would like to propose feasible solutions to process and consider \r\nthem in our cutting edge forecasting models. A support vector machine \r\n(SVM) based prediction system, multiple feature based forecasting \r\nframework (MFF) has been developed to process news, stock trend \r\ncomponents, and technical indicators as well as Volatility Index (VIX) \r\nindex in order to improve the prediction performance. At the same time, \r\nbased on the shortcoming of current literature approaches in text mining \r\nand trend components extraction, some possible methods are also discussed \r\nand verified.\r\n\r\nApart from processing and utilizing additional features, the improvement \r\nof stock forecasting accuracies is also attempted through studying \r\ninter-relationships among multiple financial time series, traditionally \r\nbelieved to be useful for investors to optimize portfolios, and \r\nspeculators to capture the chance of statistical arbitrage (most likely, \r\npair trading). Existing researches, advocate of utilizing statistical \r\ncorrelations (co-movement in prices) between different stock entities as a \r\nfactor mining method. However, the high correlation in the financial time \r\nseries does not imply the causality. Therefore, we should reasonably \r\naddress the later rather than the former. Notwithstanding the foreseeable \r\nimprovement through modeling causalities, relatively few works are \r\nconcerned with studying it and therefore explore the potential of lagging \r\neffects to boost accuracies of stock prediction. In this thesis paper, we \r\nwould like to propose a novel leading stock based prediction framework \r\n(LSPF), dedicated to mining leading stocks. By definition in this study, a \r\nstock is considered as a leader once its rising or falling is preceded to \r\nothers. In other words, the predictive power of any data modeling over led \r\nstock can be arisen by considering these leading stocks as factors in the \r\nmodeling process. LSPF tracks the inter-leading and lagging relationships \r\nbetween stock entities by investigating three feasible leading stock \r\nmining models, respectively, linear Granger causality test, non-linear \r\nGranger causality test, and lagged correlation measurement. A leadership \r\nranking approach is suggested to weight the importance of found leading \r\nand lagging stocks after mining processes.\r\n\r\nIn studies of multiple features, our extensive experiments, with use of \r\nthe Dow Jones consistent stock daily basis data in the New York Exchange \r\n(NYSE), show that our approaches with additional features obviously \r\noutperform those with price and volume only. More importantly, a \r\nprofitable simulation trading result is gained (reaching over 200% annual \r\nreturn on several stock entities, in comparison with the same period Dow \r\nJones Index performance, -25%) during the sub-prime mortgage crisis, \r\njustifying the effectiveness and robustness of our system against the \r\neconomic depression.\r\n\r\nOn the other hands, LSPF is evaluated in terms of its boosted accuracies \r\nover different prediction models, including neural network (NN) and \r\nsupport vector regression (SVR). Examined by the high frequency market \r\nmicrostructure data in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX), it has shown \r\nthat the LSPF is robust to volatile stock markets with its promising \r\nimprovement in prediction accuracies, which confirms the presence and \r\nsignificance of leading stocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 18 June 2010\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Lei Chen (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Frederick Lochovsky (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Data Mining in Finance (Multiple Features & Leading Stocks based Prediction)"], "lenArticle": 704},

As more and more high-speed links, lossy links, \r\nlong-delay links and variable-delay links are widely deployed in the Internet, \r\ntraditional end-to-end congestion control schemes exhibit several shortcomings, \r\nsuch as poor utilization of high-speed links, unfair bandwidth allocation among \r\nflows with different round-trip times (RTTs), incorrect interpretation of \r\nbit-error packet loss as congestion, and slow responsiveness to fast-changing \r\nphysical conditions of mobile nodes. To address these problems, we develop \r\nflexible and adaptive cross-layer schemes that optimize the performance \r\n(throughput, latency, fairness, etc.) of the whole networking system. We \r\npropose Quick Flow Control Protocol (QFCP) as a router-assisted congestion \r\ncontrol protocol for high bandwidth-delay product networks. It allows flows to \r\nstart with high initial sending rates indicated by routers along the path and \r\nto converge to the fair-share sending rate quickly based on feedbacks from \r\nrouters. We next extend QFCP to wireless networks so that it can distinguish \r\nbit-error loss from congestion loss and can probe the unknown bandwidth \r\ncapacity of wireless links to calculate the router feedback. Time-constraint \r\nflows are very common in vehicular communications. They have fixed start and \r\nstop times and try to maximize the transferred data volume during the limited \r\nconnection time. We find that the traditional fairness concept solely based on \r\ninstantaneous flow rates is not suitable for this scenario. Therefore, we \r\npropose new practical bandwidth sharing schemes for transferring data with \r\nfast-moving wireless nodes such as vehicles based on the utility fairness.

Sensor networks are by nature used to provide spatio-temporal \r\ninformation of physical world. Hence, it is important to associate sensed data \r\nwith locations, making data geographically meaningful. This thesis presents a \r\nsystematic study on the localization and localizability issues. Localization is \r\nan autonomous mechanism of node location computation. Network localizability \r\nanswers whether or not a network can be localized; i.e., the locations of all \r\nnetwork nodes can be uniquely determined under certain constraints. In brief, \r\nlocalization emphasizes location computation while localizability considers \r\nlocation uniqueness.\r\n\r\nWe first investigate error control in localization, a key factor that \r\ndetermines the success of a localization approach in practice. We propose the \r\nconcept of Quality of Trilateration (QoT) to quantitatively evaluate \r\ntrilaterations under inaccurate distance measurements. QoT takes both geometry \r\nand ranging errors into accounts. With the help of QoT, the proposed \r\nlocalization approach succeeds in alleviating error propagation, a main source \r\nof location error in multi-hop networks.\r\n\r\nDistributed localizability testing is also studied in this thesis. We analyze \r\nthe limitation of trilateration and propose a novel approach WHEEL, which not \r\nonly identifies localizability, but also, similar to trilateration, computes \r\nnode locations. WHEEL is based on the global rigidity of wheel graphs. It \r\ninherits the simplicity and efficiency of trilateration, while at the same time \r\nrecognizes more localizable nodes. More than that, we prove WHEEL is the \r\noptimal among all distributed approaches. WHEEL is believed to be a nice \r\nsubstitute of the widely-used trilateration.\r\n\r\nFinally, we propose the concept of node localizability. Node localizability \r\nfocuses on the location-uniqueness of a single node. Indeed, network \r\nlocalizability is a special case of node localizability in which all nodes are \r\nlocalizable. Applying rigidity theory, we study the conditions of a node being \r\nlocalizable. For the first time, it is possible to answer the fundamental \r\nquestions of localization: how many nodes in a network are localizable in a \r\npartially localizable network and which they are.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 29 June 2010\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:00am \u2013 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Chun Man Chan (CIVL)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Yunhao Liu (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Lionel Ni\r\n \t\t\tProf. Qian Zhang\r\n                         Prof. Susheng Wang (ECON)\r\n                         Prof. Xiaohua Jia (Comp.

At the same \r\ntime, more and more unique challenges have been introduced. In this thesis, we \r\npresent our current research status on two different topics: a novel \r\nenergy-efficient event collection scheme, and a measurement study focusing on \r\nnon-orthogonal multi-channel design of WSNs.\r\n\r\nWe consider an event collection scenario in a 2D region. Using traditional \r\nmulti-hop routing to report events to a sink node or base station, will result \r\nin severe imbalanced energy consumption of static sensors. In addition, full \r\nconnectivity among all the static sensors may not be possible in some cases. \r\nTherefore, we exploit a mobile sensor as the sink node to assist the event \r\ncollection by controlling the movement of the mobile sink to collect static \r\nsensor readings. A key observation of our work is that an event has \r\nspatial-temporal correlation. Specifically, the same event can be detected by \r\nmultiple nearby sensors within a period of time. Thus, it is more \r\nenergy-efficient if the mobile sink can selectively communicate with only a \r\nportion of static sensors, while still collecting all the interested events. We \r\ndiscuss the event collection problem by leveraging the mobility of the sink \r\nnode and the spatial-temporal correlation of the event, in favor of maximizing \r\nthe network lifetime with a guaranteed event collection rate.\r\n\r\nIn addition, another critical issue in WSNs is represented by the network \r\nthroughput. To meet the throughput requirement, researchers propose \r\nmulti-channel design in 802.15.4 networks to better utilize the wireless medium \r\nand avoid the co-channel interference. We argue that the orthogonality is not \r\nnecessary for multi-channel design in WSNs and investigate the feasibility of \r\nnon-orthogonal channel design. In our experiment, we observe that with \r\nnon-orthogonal transmission, the effect of interference comes from co-channel \r\nand inter-channel is different, i.e., the inter-channel interference is more \r\ntolerable. Based on that, we propose a novel scheme DCN (Dynamic CCA-threshold \r\nfor Non-orthogonal transmission) which adjusts the CCA-threshold to enable the \r\nconcurrent transmissions on adjacent non-orthogonal channels and thus improve \r\nthe overall network throughput performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 29 June 2010\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Qian Zhang (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Yunhao Liu (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lin Gu\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Event collection and Measurement Study of Wireless Sensor Networks"], "lenArticle": 409},

For the nature of broadcast in \r\nwireless network, the source signal transmitted via wireless medium can be \r\noverheard by the neighboring nodes. Cooperative communication exploits \r\noverheard information from the surrounding nodes to achieve higher throughput \r\nand reliability. Such technique can be used in different types of wireless \r\nnetworks, such as, infrastructured networks, ad-hoc networks, and etc.\r\n\r\nIn the past decade, if the users within a local area are interested in the same \r\ncontent from one source, they can only use some simple broadcast techniques to \r\nsolve their need. However, the efficiency is poor especially for mutli-hop \r\ntransmission. The cooperative communication technique is a promising method to \r\nimprove the performance for this problem.

We showed that the forecasting for sports betting \r\nand political events can be significantly improved by using sentiment analysis \r\nas a pre-processor. The reason is that the sentiment data is generated from a \r\nwide-covered news sources and can be viewed as an aggregation of a very large \r\ngroup of people. As argued by The Wisdom of Crowds, decision draw from \r\naggregation of information in groups are often better than those could have \r\nbeen made by any single member of the group.\r\n\r\nWe also showed that with sentiment analysis data, even simple intuitive models, \r\nlike linear regression model and regression model with exponentially weighted \r\nmoving average technique, can generate better results. We also further derived \r\nprofitable strategies for sports betting and accurate forecasting for political \r\nevents. As a result, our experimental results also validated our sentiment \r\nanalysis system em Lydia.\r\n\r\nWe hope further investigation of the usage of sentiment data in forecasting can \r\nbe performed in different areas, like national economical data forecasting, \r\nmost popular product forecasting, and even Oscar awardee forecasting.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 30 June 2010\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 4483\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Mordecai Golin (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Steven Skiena (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["EVENT FORECASTING THROUGH NEWS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS"], "lenArticle": 330},

But one of the major business frauds in \r\ntaxi is the charging fraud, specifically, charging more fees than the \r\nactual service distance. In practice, it is hard for us to always monitor \r\ntaxis and detect such fraud. Thanks to the Global Position System (GPS) \r\nembedded in taxis, we can collect the GPS reports from the taxis, having \r\nthe location, time, and driving information. Intuitively, we can utilize \r\nsuch data to compute the actual service distance of taxis in the city map. \r\nBut due to the extremely limited report, notable location errors, complex \r\ncity map and road networks, our task to detect the taxi fraud faces great \r\nchallenges and the naive method does not work well.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we have a basic observation that the fraud taxi always \r\nchanges the taximeter in a much larger scale, and as a result it not only \r\nmakes the service distance larger, but also the reported taxi speed much \r\nlarger. Fortunately, the speed information collected from the GPS report \r\nis accurate. Hence, we utilize the speed information to design a novel \r\nspeed-based clustering method to detect the fraud taxi, which is robust to \r\nthe location errors, and independent of the map and road networks.

To \r\nfacilitate clinical assessment of blood vessels, there is a growing need \r\nof developing computer assisted vessel segmentation schemes based on \r\nmagnetic resonance angiographic (MRA) images. A vast number of approaches \r\nhave been proposed in the past decade for the segmentation of vascular \r\nstructures in MRA images.

The \r\ndevelopment of these approaches aims at delivering more accurate and \r\nrobust segmentation results. Nonetheless, these approaches face different \r\ntechnical challenges that prohibit them from being widely employed in the \r\nclinical environment. The challenges include significant contrast \r\nvariation of vessel boundaries in MRA images, the excessive computation \r\ntime required by some algorithms and the complicated geometry of vascular \r\nstructures.

This detector is robust against large intensity contrast \r\nchanges and capable of returning accurate detection responses on low \r\ncontrast edges. Our second method is an efficient implementation of a well \r\nfounded vessel detection approach.

In this \r\nthesis, we particularly focus on developing novel features for robust \r\nimage registration and designing an efficient evaluation protocol to \r\nmeasure the robustness and discriminant power of the features.\r\n\r\nFirst, in the spatial domain, a new image feature called the uniform \r\nspherical region descriptor (USRD) is proposed. The USRD feature is \r\nrotation and monotonic gray-level transformation invariant, and is also \r\ncomputationally efficient. Each voxel is represented by its own USRD \r\nfeature signature. The USRD feature is integrated with the Markov random \r\nfield labeling framework for image registration. Second, we propose the \r\nsymmetric alpha stable (S\u03b1S) filters to extract image features in the \r\nfrequency domain. The S\u03b1S filters are proposed because the energy \r\nspectrums of brain MR images often exhibit non-Gaussian heavy-tail \r\nbehaviors which cannot be satisfactorily modeled by the conventional Gabor \r\nfilters. The conventional Gabor filter is a special case of the S\u03b1S \r\nfilters. The maximum response orientation criterion is designed to xiii \r\nmake the S\u03b1S feature rotation invariant. The S\u03b1S feature is integrated \r\nwith the subvolume deformation model in the registration process. \r\nMoreover, in this thesis, we propose the Fisher's separation criterion \r\n(FSC) protocol which can directly evaluate the discriminant power of \r\nvarious types of features.\r\n\r\nFinally, a multi-layer framework is proposed to extract features from \r\ninput images from different views. The proposed methods are evaluated by \r\nperforming non-rigid registration experiments. The proposed methods are \r\nalso compared with several state-of-the-art registration approaches. It is \r\ndemonstrated that the proposed methods consistently achieve the highest \r\nregistration accuracies among all the compared methods, which is matched \r\nwith the results obtained from the proposed FSC evaluation protocol.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 22 July 2010\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Alexis Lau (CIVL)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Albert Chung (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Pedro Sander\r\n \t\t\tProf. Chi-Keung Tang\r\n                     \tProf. Oscar Au (ECE)\r\n                        \tProf. Pheng-Ann Heng (Comp.

These concurrency bugs give rise \r\nto the problem of data-consistency errors, which can lead to drastic \r\nconsequences (e.g., the Northeast Blackout of 2003). However, detecting \r\nconcurrency bugs is difficult because these bugs are manifested only under \r\nvery specific thread interleavings but the number of possible \r\ninterleavings for a multithreaded program is often myriad.\r\n\r\nThis thesis presents program analysis techniques to automatically verify \r\nthat a multithreaded program correctly uses synchronization primitives to \r\nguarantee atomic-set serializability, a data-consistency criterion \r\nrecently proposed for better detection of concurrency bugs. Atomic-set \r\nserializability characterizes a wide range of concurrency bugs. In \r\naddition, previous experiences using this criterion show that it is less \r\nlikely to have benign violations than the other criteria. This thesis \r\naddresses the following two problems on detecting atomic-set \r\nserializability violations: inadequate interleaving coverage and \r\ninadequate input coverage.\r\n\r\nFirst, dynamic approaches are widely used to detect errors (e.g., malign \r\ndata race) caused by concurrency bugs. Existing dynamic approaches for \r\ndetecting such violations are based on runtime monitoring. Their \r\neffectiveness is restricted by the inadequate coverage of interleavings. \r\nTo address this problem, this thesis proposes a dynamic predictive \r\nanalysis technique that can infer potential violations from executions \r\nthat are even violation-free, and an active randomized testing technique \r\nthat can quickly confirm real violations reported by the dynamic \r\npredictive analysis technique.\r\n\r\nSecond, for a given set of tests, our dynamic predictive analysis \r\ntechnique and active randomized testing technique partially alleviate the \r\nproblem of inadequate coverage of thread interleaving. However, the input \r\ncoverage of our testing technique is restricted to that of the given \r\ntests. To address this problem, this thesis proposes an effective static \r\nchecking technique to automatically detect atomic-set serializability \r\nviolations. Existing static approaches for detecting such violations use \r\npath-sensitive analyses, which are usually not scalable for large \r\nprograms. To address the scalability issue, this thesis proposes a series \r\nof flow-insensitive analyses which scale to programs with thousands of \r\nlines of code.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 27 July 2010\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:00am \u2013 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Johnny Sin (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Lin Gu\r\n \t\t\tProf. Charles Zhang\r\n                         Prof. Mitchell Tseng (IELM)\r\n                         Prof. Michael Lyu (Comp.

It introduces latent variables to a naive \r\nBayes (NB) model to represent the potentional conditional dependences \r\namong attribute variables that are not captured by the class variable. \r\nHence HNBs can model more complex dependencies among the attributes and \r\nalleviate the disadvantages of NB models for classification.\r\n\r\nMore formally, HNB models are tree-shaped Bayesian networks (BNs) where \r\nthe root represents the class variable, leaf nodes represent attributes, \r\nwhile internal nodes represent latent variables.\r\n\r\nThis thesis is concerned with the problem of learning HNB models from the \r\ndata. General learning algorithms for HNB models are computational \r\nexpensive and thus cannot be applied to large scale problems. In this \r\nthesis, we propose a new efficient algorithm.

However, it is not uncommon for some \r\nreal-world data, such as web pages and research papers, to contain \r\nrelationships (links) between the instances. Different instances in such \r\ndata are correlated (linked) with each other, which implies that the \r\ncommon i.i.d. assumption is unreasonable for such relational data. Hence, \r\nnaively applying traditional statistical learning methods to relational \r\ndata may lead to misleading conclusion about the data.\r\n\r\nStatistical relational learning (SRL), which attempts to perform learning \r\nand inference in domains with complex relational structure, has become an \r\nemerging research area because relational data widely exist in a large \r\nvariety of application areas, such as web mining, social network analysis, \r\nbioinformatics, economics and marketing. The existing mainstream SRL \r\nmodels extend traditional graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and \r\nMarkov networks, by eliminating their underlying i.i.d. assumption. Some \r\ntypical examples of such SRL models include relational Bayesian networks, \r\nrelational Markov networks, and Markov logic networks. Because the \r\ndependency structure in relational data is typically very complex, \r\nstructure learning for these relational graphical models is often very \r\ntime-consuming. Hence, it might be impractical to apply these models to \r\nlarge-scale relational data sets.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we propose a series of novel SRL models, called relational \r\nfactor models (RFMs), by extending traditional latent factor models from \r\ni.i.d. domains to relational domains. These proposed RFMs provide a \r\ntoolbox for different learning settings: some of them are well suitable \r\nfor transductive inference while others can be used for inductive \r\ninference; some of them are parametric while others are nonparametric; \r\nsome of them can be used to model data with undirected relationships while \r\nothers can be used for data with directed relationships. One promising \r\nadvantage of our RFMs is that there is no need for the time-consuming \r\nstructure learning and the time complexity of most of them is linear to \r\nthe number of observed links in the data. This implies that our RFMs can \r\nbe used to model large-scale data sets. Experimental results show that our \r\nmodels can achieve state-of-the-art performance in many real-world \r\napplications such as linked-document classification and social network \r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 30 July 2010\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t3:00pm \u2013 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Andrew Poon (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. James Kwok\r\n \t\t\tProf. Nevin Zhang\r\n                      \tProf. Weichuan Yu (ECE)\r\n                         Prof. Huan Liu (Comp.

Although shortest \r\npath problems in graphs and in planes are well-studied, there are not much \r\nstudies about finding shortest paths on terrain surfaces.

The \r\nalgorithm guarantees that the slope of the path does not exceed a maximum slope \r\nvalue defined by users, and the length of the path is the shortest among all \r\nsuch paths. Since traditional surface shortest paths can be viewed as shortest \r\ngentle paths with a maximum slope value equal to \u03c0/2, our problem is more \r\ngeneral than the traditional surface shortest path problem.

In \r\nthis thesis, we present our current research status on exploiting node mobility \r\nin wireless sensor networks. We first investigate the impact of node mobility \r\non localization which is the fundamental issue in mobile sensor networks. By \r\nleveraging different types of relative distance constraints, we propose a \r\ndistributed and range-free Mobile Inequality Localization (MIL) algorithm, \r\nwhich is quickly re-localizable when all sensors are moving uncontrollably. \r\nWith location awareness, we further analyze several unique issues in mobile \r\nsensor networks.

By \r\nintroducing the concept of probabilistic coverage, we develop a basic platform \r\nto provide the real-time coverage status for a given region. In addition, we \r\naddress a double-mobility problem in coverage and propose a distributed \r\nprotocol SSC to collaborate between controllable and uncontrollable mobility to \r\nmaintain the coverage. The other issue is about the event collection. By \r\nleveraging the spatial-temporal correlation of events, we propose an online \r\nscheme for mobile nodes to selectively collect event information.

To solve this \r\nproblem, Cognitive Radio (CR) is proposed to improve spectrum utility \r\nwithout interference to licensed users. CR need to keep aware of wireless \r\nenvironment by spectrum sensing and access unused bands without \r\ninterference to licensed users. In this proposal we focus on two important \r\nissues in CR networks: spectrum sensing and multi-user cooperation. i) \r\nSpectrum sensing is the key component of CR technology. We improve \r\nspectrum sensing by studying spectrum usage prediction and cooperative \r\nspectrum sensing. Spectrum usage prediction can significantly reduce the \r\nsensing range basing on history information. We conduct a large scale \r\nempirical study basing on realworld measurement to reveal the \r\npredictability and ideal predictors for spectrum usage. We also propose a \r\nnew spectrum sensing scheme assisted with spectrum prediction. Cooperative \r\nspectrum sensing is introduced to improve sensitivity with spatial \r\ndiversity. We improve it by designing a Carrot-and-Stick based strategy to \r\nstimulate cooperation, relaxing it into asynchronous mode and introducing \r\nmulti-channel coordination mechanism. ii) Because the wireless environment \r\nof CR networks is more complicated and unstable comparing with traditional \r\nwireless networks, the cooperation of multiple users is more important. \r\nCooperative spectrum sensing is a good example and we also study another \r\ntwo important problems: stimulating data forwarding and CR network \r\nplanning. For stimulating data forwarding, we show that the traditional \r\nsolutions are context-based and our new proposed context-free solution is \r\nmore lightweight and bug-free.

Multiple description coding (MDC) can be used to address \r\nthis bandwidth heterogeneity issue. In MDC, the video source is encoded \r\ninto multiple independent descriptions. A receiver, depending on its \r\navailable bandwidth, joins different descriptions to meet their bandwidth \r\nrequirements. An important but challenging problem for MDC video multicast \r\nis how to assign bandwidth to each description in order to maximize \r\noverall user satisfaction. In this paper, we investigate this issue by \r\nformulating it as an optimization problem, with the objective to maximize \r\nuser bandwidth experience by taking into account the encoding inefficiency \r\ndue to MDC.\r\n\r\nWe prove that the optimization problem is in general NP-hard. However, if \r\nthe description number is larger than or equal to a certain threshold (for \r\na bandwidth heterogeneity of a factor of 100, such threshold is 7 \r\ndescriptions), there is an exact and simple solution to achieve maximum \r\nuser satisfaction, i.e. meeting all the receiving bandwidth requirements. \r\nFor the case when the description number is smaller, we present an \r\nefficient heuristic called SAMBA (Simulated Annealing for MDC Bandwidth \r\nAssignment) to assign bandwidth to each description given the distribution \r\nof user bandwidth requirement.\r\n\r\nWe evaluate our algorithm using simulations. SAMBA achieves virtually the \r\nsame optimal performance based on exhaustive search. By comparing with \r\nother assignment algorithms, SAMBA significantly improves user \r\nsatisfaction.

IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) have become \r\nincreasingly popular due to the recent availability of affordable devices \r\nproviding multiple and high rate capabilities. Optimizing the performance \r\nof wireless networks for emerging network applications is an important and \r\na highly challenging issue.\r\n\r\nIn the next generation WLAN standard, termed IEEE 802.11n, new PHY and MAC \r\nlayer enhancements have been introduced. These improvements have given \r\nbirth to high throughput and high data rates to keep up with current and \r\nupcoming Internet applications. In this thesis, we investigate various \r\nissues related to the new 802.11n and legacy standards. The fundamental \r\nproblem is that 802.11 WLANs exhibit rich channel dynamics including \r\nrandom channel errors due to interference, mobility-induced channel \r\nvariation, and contention from hidden stations. As a result, the \r\nthroughput of IEEE 802.11 devices is affected due to the wireless channel \r\nconditions. In particular, rate control is a fundamental resource \r\nmanagement issue for 802.11 devices; its goal is to optimize the link \r\nthroughput in various wireless environments.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we concentrate on this important issue of rate adaptation \r\nfor 802.11-based WLANs. All the IEEE 802.11 standards do not specify any \r\nalgorithm for automatic rate control. The basic idea of rate adaptation is \r\nto estimate the current channel condition and dynamically select the best \r\nrate out of multiple available transmission rates. Many rate adaptation \r\nschemes have been proposed in recent years, some of them are not \r\nrelatively easy to implement by requiring modifications or additions to \r\nthe IEEE 802.11 standard. We present a novel rate control algorithm, which \r\nextends a legacy scheme with new features suitable for forthcoming 802.11n \r\nproducts. We also implement this scheme in real hardware devices and then \r\nevaluate their performance compared to the existing rate control \r\nmechanisms. The experiments prove that our rate adaptation algorithm \r\nallows the current wireless hardware to have a greater adaptability to a \r\nvariety of channel conditions.\r\n\r\nFor future work, we will study other wireless networks such as IEEE \r\n802.11p for vehicular Ad-hoc networks and IEEE 802.16 mesh networks. We \r\nbelieve that the approach discussed in this thesis could also provide a \r\nflexible structure for various systems, and optimize the performance of \r\nthe next generation of wireless networks.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 20 August 2010\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:00am \u2013 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 5566\r\n \t\t\tLifts 27/28\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Mounir Hamdi (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Gary Chan (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lin Gu\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Design and Experimentation of Rate Adaptation for IEEE 802.11n WLANs"], "lenArticle": 430},

To \r\nease debugging, researchers have proposed various dynamic analysis \r\ntechniques that aid developers in locating the program defects based on \r\npassed and failed test runs. In this thesis, we study a prevalent type of \r\ndefects called code omission faults, which involve missing code and cannot \r\nbe ascribed to any program entity that exists in the program. Code \r\nomission faults pose two major challenges to existing dynamic analysis \r\ntechniques. First, missing code offers no execution behavior to observe \r\ndirectly. Second, even when the place of omission could have been \r\naccurately pinpointed, it is still difficult for developers to conjecture \r\nthe missing code.\r\n\r\nTo address these challenges of code omission, we conducted an empirical \r\nstudy to characterize real-world omission faults. Among non-trivial bug \r\nfixes extracted from large open source projects GNU/GCC and MYSQL, we \r\nfound that over half of them correspond to omission faults, which can be \r\nfurther categorized into 11 sub-types. Among them, we made a novel \r\ndiscovery that some sub-types, such as missing-assignment or \r\nmissing-return, often induce certain dynamic control flows and data flows \r\npatterns when they trigger program failures. We express these patterns in \r\nan event flow language and show that by matching them against program \r\nexecution, it is possible to accurately locate these sub-types of omission \r\nfaults and infer part of the missing code.\r\n\r\nThe remaining sub-types of omission faults, such as missing-if-condition \r\nand missing-branch, are more complex and induce patterns that vary with \r\nthe missing code, which is mostly unknown at the time of debugging. For \r\nthese complex omission faults, we empirically observed that the missing \r\ncode likely appear elsewhere in a similar or even the same form. Inspired \r\nby this observation, we propose an approach called learning-to-debug. The \r\nbasic idea is to systematically remove different parts of the program and \r\nlearn the control-/data- flow patterns that are associated with these \r\npieces of artificially removed code. The inferred patterns are then \r\napplied on the original program to locate the omission faults. We have \r\ndesigned a novel pattern representation and a learning algorithm in order \r\nto make learning-to-debug scalable.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate our approaches, we used both real world and seeded omission \r\nfaults in four benchmark programs: space, grep, bc, and gcc.

Thus, it is hard for a search engine to figure out what the \r\nusers precisely want. Most commercial search engines simply return the \r\nsame set of results to all users who ask the same query. However, \r\ndifferent users may have different preferences on the result set. Thus, \r\npersonalization is needed in order to rank the results according to a \r\nuser's personal preferences. In this thesis, we develop two methods to \r\nmine a user's conceptual preferences from search engine clickthrough data, \r\nand adjust the search result ranking according to the extracted \r\npreferences to improve the retrieval effectiveness for the user.\r\n\r\nWe first propose a framework that supports mining a user's conceptual \r\npreferences from users' clickthrough data resulted from web search. The \r\ndiscovered preferences are utilized to adapt a search engine's ranking \r\nfunction. In the framework, an extended set of conceptual preferences was \r\nderived for a user based on the concepts extracted from the search results \r\nand the clickthrough data. Then, an Ontology-based User Profile (OUP) \r\nrepresenting the user profile as a concept ontology tree is generated. \r\nFinally, the OUP is input to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to learn a \r\nconcept preference vector for adapting a personalized ranking function \r\nthat re-ranks the search results. We confirm that our approach is able to \r\nimprove significantly the retrieval effectiveness for the user.\r\n\r\nWe then adopt the OUP approach in the area of location-based \r\npersonalization.  We propose a personalized mobile search engine, PMSE, \r\nthat captures the users' preferences in the form of concepts by mining \r\ntheir clickthrough data. Due to the importance of location information in \r\nmobile search, PMSE classifies these concepts into content concepts and \r\nlocation concepts. In addition, users' locations (positioned by GPS) are \r\nused to supplement the location concepts in PMSE. The user preferences are \r\norganized in an ontology-based, multi-facet user profile, which are used \r\nto adapt a personalized ranking function for rank adaptation of future \r\nsearch results. To characterize the diversity of the concepts associated \r\nwith a query and their relevances to the user's need, four entropies are \r\nintroduced to balance the weights between the content and location facets. \r\nWe also present a detailed client-server architecture of PMSE. In our \r\ndesign, the client collects and stores locally the clickthrough data to \r\nprotect privacy, whereas resource consuming tasks such as concept \r\nextraction, training and reranking are performed at the PMSE server. We \r\nprototype PMSE on the Google Android platform. Experimental results show \r\nthat PMSE significantly improves retrieval effectiveness comparing to the \r\nbaseline without personalization.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 25 August 2010\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Chih-Chen Chang (CIVL)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dik-Lun Lee (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Wilfred Ng (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Frederick Lochovsky\r\n \t\t\tProf. Raymond Wong\r\n                         Prof. Bilian Ni Sullivan (MGMT)\r\n                         Prof. Robert Luk (Comp., PolyU)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["A Framework For Personalizing Web Search with Multi-Faceted User Profiles"], "lenArticle": 519},

In this\r\nreport, we mainly focus on the challenges of information collection\r\nand intrusion detection in mobile sensor networks.\r\n\r\nWe study the delay-constrained information coverage problem\r\nin mobile sensor networks. Motivated by real application needs, our\r\nformulation takes advantage of the sensor mobility for sensing\r\ninformation collection, which takes place when a sensor moves into\r\nthe proximity (single hop) of stationary sink nodes. We also study\r\nrelay assisted information collection. By taking full advantage of\r\nsensor mobility and rendezvous during senor node encounter, messages\r\ncan be delivered to a sink node either directly or through relays by\r\nother sensor nodes. Under the relay assisted case, we study the\r\nmessage delivery capacity problem in delay-constrained\r\nmobile sensor networks. The message delivery capacity specifies the\r\nmaximum percentage of sensing messages that can be successfully\r\ndelivered to sink nodes within a given time constraint. This\r\ncaptures the overall system capacity in term of successful sensing\r\nmessage delivery.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, we present the delay-constrained message\r\ndelivery capacity formulation in mobile sensor networks. The\r\nobjective is to maximize the message delivery capacity subject to\r\nthe delay and buffering constraints. We first identify a number of\r\nunique challenges involved in such systems including message relay\r\nand buffer replacement mechanisms, and we derive the capacity bound\r\nunder perfect message relay and buffer replacement mechanisms. Due\r\nto the unrealistic assumption for the foreknowledge of sensor moving\r\ntrajectories, we next proceed to propose a practical algorithm to\r\napproximate the maximal message delivery capacity based on the\r\ncurrent global network knowledge. Furthermore, a distributed\r\nalgorithm is proposed to reduce the control overhead for information\r\nexchange. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms and examine the\r\nsensitivity with respect to  delay constraint, buffer size and\r\nmessage relay and replacement schemes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, prior works in static sensor environments show\r\nthat constructing sensor barriers with random sensor deployment can\r\nbe effective for intrusion detection. In response to the recent\r\nsurge of interest in mobile sensor applications, we study the\r\nintrusion detection problem in a mobile sensor network, where it is\r\nbelieved that mobile sensors can improve barrier coverage.\r\nSpecifically, we focus on providing k-barrier coverage\r\nagainst moving intruders. This problem becomes particularly\r\nchallenging given that the trajectories of sensors and intruders\r\nneed to be captured.\r\n\r\nWe first demonstrate that this problem is similar to the classical\r\nkinetic theory of gas molecules in physics. We then derive the\r\ninherent relationship between barrier coverage performance and a set\r\nof crucial system parameters including sensor density, sensing\r\nrange, sensor and intruder mobility. We examine the correlations and\r\nsensitivity from the system parameters, and we derive the minimum\r\nnumber of mobile sensors that needs to be deployed in order to\r\nmaintain the $k$-barrier coverage for a mobile sensor network.\r\nFinally, we show that the coverage performance can be improved by an\r\norder of magnitude with the same number of sensors when compared\r\nwith that of the static sensor environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:  \t\t\tTuesday, 31 August 2010\r\n\r\nTime:           \t10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:          \tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tlifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Bo Li (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Qian Zhang (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lin Gu\r\n \t\t\tProf. Chin-Tau Lea (ECE)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["The Information Collection and Intrusion Detection in Mobile Sensor Networks"], "lenArticle": 580},

It is well known that fuzzy database\r\nmodels based on the fuzzy set theory by have been introduced to handle\r\nuncertain data, which exist in many real life applications. Essentially,\r\nin a fuzzy set (FS) each element is associated with a point-value\r\nselected from the unit interval [0,1], which is termed the grade of\r\nmembership in the set. A vague set (VS) is a further generalization of\r\nan FS. Instead of using point-based membership as in FSs, interval-based\r\nmember- ship is used in a VS. The interval-based membership in VSs is\r\nmore expressive in capturing vagueness of data. Thus, we extend\r\nrelational data model by vague set theory to handle uncertain\r\ninformation. In our initial work, we utilize functional dependencies\r\n(FDs), which are the most fundamental integrity constraints that arise in\r\npractice in relational databases, to maintain the consistency of a vague\r\ndatabase by adopting the vague chase (VChase) procedure. We also propose\r\nthe concept of vague association rule (VAR). VARs address a limitation in\r\nthe traditional association rule (AR) mining problem, which ignores the\r\nhesitation information of items in transactions. For example, in many\r\nonline shopping applications, the items that are put into the basket but\r\nnot checked out carry hesitation information.

Latent variable models originate\r\nfrom psychometrics (Spearman, 1904), developed in social science,\r\nstatistics, education testing theory, and recently gain interests in\r\nmachine learning. Examples of latent variable models include hidden\r\nMarkov models (HMMs), latent class models, factor analysis, etc.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis we study a class of latent variable models known as\r\nlatent tree (LT) models. LT models are tree-structured Bayesian\r\nnetworks where the leaf nodes represent manifest variables while\r\ninternal nodes represent latent variables. We investigate the\r\nautomatic induction of LT models from data, and the use of LT models\r\nin cluster analysis of categorical data.\r\n\r\nSeveral search-based algorithms for learning LT models have been\r\ndeveloped. However there are important issues that remain poorly\r\nunderstood. In this thesis we study three such issues, namely\r\noperation granularity, efficient model evaluation and range of model\r\nadjustment. The investigation sheds new light on search-based\r\nlearning of LT models and leads to a new algorithm that is\r\nconceptually simpler and more efficient than the state-of-the-art\r\nand yet finds better models.\r\n\r\nLT models can be used for latent structure discovery and density\r\nestimation. In this thesis we demonstrate their usefulness in\r\ncluster analysis of categorical data. We compare LT analysis with\r\nlatent class (LC) analysis, a previous method for the same task. It\r\nturns out that LT analysis is superior to LC analysis in terms of\r\nboth the quantity and the depth of the discoveries that they make.\r\nIn particular it automatically searches for multiple meaningful\r\ndimensions to cluster data while LC analysis always clusters data in\r\none single way.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tFriday, 5 September 2008\r\n\r\nTime:                   1:30p.m.-3:30p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3402\r\n \t\t\tlifts 17-18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Nevin Zhang (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. James Kwok (Chairperson)\r\n                         Prof. Mordecai Golin\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Search-Based Learning of Latent Tree Models"], "lenArticle": 331},

In this \r\nproposal, two important issues about robust packet video transmission are \r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\nThe first issue is error resilient video compression. Motivated by \r\ntwo-hypothesis motion-compensated prediction (THMCP), we first propose an error \r\nresilient video coding technique, where two-hypothesis and one-hypothesis \r\npredictions are alternately used to encode the video stream. We use some \r\nschemes to determine which kind of prediction should be used, so that in some \r\ncases of frame losses, the propagated error can be first decreased to some \r\nextent before it spreads to the subsequent frames. Then we extend the previous \r\nwork for THMCP to a more generalized one, i.e. the reference frames can be some \r\ndistance from the current frame, instead of only the immediately preceding \r\nones. Three types of prediction patterns are proposed and implemented by the \r\ngeneralized B pictures in H.264/AVC. In the case of a single frame loss during \r\nthe transmission, the induced error propagation is analyzed and the closed-form \r\nexpression for error energy is derived.\r\n\r\nThe second issue is error concealment for frame losses in video transmission. \r\nWe first propose an error concealment algorithm to reconstruct a lost frame in \r\nthe odd/even temporal sub-sampling MDC. The neighboring frames in the \r\nerror-free stream are used to temporally interpolate the lost frame, based the \r\npreserved motion vector in this correct stream. To further improve the \r\nreconstructed video quality after the lost one, we also propose a \r\nmulti-hypothesis error concealment (MHC) algorithm. In addition to \r\nerror-concealing the lost frame, MHC also applies temporal interpolation to \r\nsome additional frames after the frame loss so as to reduce propagated error \r\nquickly. Finally, we propose two error concealment algorithms for INTRA-frame \r\nlosses over packet loss channels. The novelty is that not only the INTRA-frame \r\nbut also the subsequent INTER-frames are error concealed based on the strong \r\ncorrelation between adjacent pixel values. In addition, motion compensation is \r\nused to reconstruct the INTER-pixel which has an INTRA-pixel in its motion \r\ntrajectory.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tMonday, 22 September 2008\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:00a.m.-12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n \t\t\tlifts 25-26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Gary Chan (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Oscar Au (Supervisor, ECE)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Albert Chung (Chairperson)\r\n                         Dr. David Rossiter\r\n \t\t\tDr. Pedro Sander\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Error Resilience and Concealment Techniques for Packet Video Transmission"], "lenArticle": 395},

Compared to SQL, it has several benefits. First, \r\nR-KWS hides the schema from users and allows searching for combinations of \r\nterms without knowing in which data sources they appear. Second, its \r\nqueries are easy to express. Third, many search tasks only become feasible \r\nthrough R-KWS. However, R-KWS is a young concept that holds many \r\nchallenges. First, it lacks common semantics, and different \r\nimplementations encounter various pitfalls. Second, its simplicity comes \r\nat a high computational cost. Specifically, R-KWS explores a vast search \r\nspace, composed of all possible combinations of keyword occurrences in any \r\nattribute of every table. There are two general methodologies for query \r\nprocessing: (i) graph based (GB), traversing a materialized data graph, \r\nand (ii) operator based (OB), executing a set of relational operator \r\ntrees. In both cases, a large portion of the computations are wasted on \r\ntraversals/operators that fail to return results. Finally, while data \r\nstreams become increasingly important to our information landscapes, R-KWS \r\nhas been restrained to static data. The contribution of this paper is thus \r\nthreefold. First, it provides homogenized semantics and matching query \r\nprocessing methods (GB as well as OB) that are formally shown to be \r\ncorrect. Second, it introduces a comprehensive framework for reachability \r\nindexing that quickly collapses the search space, and leads to significant \r\nsavings. Third, it extends R-KWS to continuous queries over relational \r\ndata streams. In particular, it proposes temporal semantics, as well as \r\nmatching query processing techniques (GB as well as OB) that are further \r\noptimized. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high practicability of \r\nR-KWS, on tables as well as streams, and the significant benefits of the \r\nproposed optimizations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 26 September 2008\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:30p.m.-4:30p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 4480\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25-26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Chi-Ying Tsui (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dimitris Papadias (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tProf. Mounir Hamdi\r\n \t\t\tProf. Ajay Joneja (IELM)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Kian-Lee Tan (Comp.

Both facts impose a challenge on the router's scalability with \r\nregard to the increasing number of network flows and switching ports. In \r\naddition, routers are also required to be able to provide Quality-of-Service \r\n(QoS) at the surge of triple-play services (data, voice and video) in \r\nNext-Generation-Networks (NGN).  In this thesis, we try to address this \r\nswitching ports scalability issue and design the routers with QoS support as \r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThe two main router components we are investigating are: the switch fabric and \r\nthe memory subsystem. We start from the Space-Memory-Space switch design \r\nparadigm that is proven to provide QoS relatively easily, and then use the \r\nClos-interconnection to scale its space parts. By making all packet buffers \r\nfully shared (in a distributed way), we show that the Central-stage Buffered \r\nClos-network (CBC namely) are scalable in terms of not only the hardware cost, \r\nbut the complexities of scheduling algorithms as well. To scale the router's \r\nmemory subsystem, we introduce parallelism into current SRAM/DRAM combination \r\nsolutions and design a Parallel Hybrid SRAM/DRAM (PHSD namely) memory system. \r\nBy simple yet efficient memory management algorithms, we show that the PHSD can \r\nsignificantly outperform previous solutions by reducing both the packet delay \r\nand the costly requirement on SRAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 15 October 2008\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:30a.m.-12:30p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 4480\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25-26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Ravindra Goonetilleke (IELM)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Mounir Hamdi (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Mordecai Golin\r\n \t\t\tProf. Qian Zhang\r\n \t\t\tProf. Chi-Ying Tsui (ECE)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Hussein Mouftah (Inf.

It has remarkably changed our daily life affecting all \r\nits aspects. Undoubtedly the Internet will continue to thrive and expand \r\nto reach its full potential. However, the TCP/IP architecture, upon which \r\nthe Internet has been built, has shown its limits. In the layered design \r\nwithin the TCP/IP architecture, the Network Layer only provides \r\nbest-effort packet delivery service, while the efficiency and fairness in \r\nthe network are relinquished to the congestion control mechanism \r\nimplemented at the Transport Layer. As the Internet evolves the original \r\nTCP/IP design faces more and more heterogeneous environments, which are \r\nfar more complex than the network scenario for which it was designed. In \r\nparticular, some of the changes violate some basic assumptions of the \r\ndesign. For example, the conventional TCP cannot perform well in networks \r\nwith high bandwidth-delay product or in wireless networks with \r\nnon-congestion-related packet losses; on the other hand, designed for \r\npacket routing, without any control the IP network is vulnerable to \r\nmisbehaving end systems. Quality of Service (QoS) enhancements on IP \r\nnetworks have been proposed for decades and yet the Internet is still not \r\nthere due to the deployment complexity involved with such mechanisms. With \r\nthe current scale of the Internet, any radical changes to the TCP/IP \r\nprotocol stack are very unlikely. Effective yet simple enhancements \r\ninvolving modification at only one part in the Internet, the end system or \r\nthe intermediate routers, seem easy to deploy and more practical. This \r\nthesis proposal focuses on congestion control and fair bandwidth \r\nallocation issues in the Internet and discusses how the intermediate \r\nrouters or the end systems can be enhanced to make the architecture more \r\nrobust in heterogeneous Internet environments.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, we first study how the synchronized loss effect affects \r\nthe fairness principle achieved by many newly proposed TCP variants in \r\nhigh-speed networks. We then propose a new low-cost AQM scheme, SiFTM, to \r\nprovide better intra- and inter-protocol fairness to support heterogeneous \r\ntransmission protocols. SiFTM can also prevent end users from acting \r\nintrusively. Finally we proposed a new congestion control protocol to \r\nachieve improved performance in presence of IEEE 802.11 wireless networks \r\nalong the connection path.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tTuesday, 25 November 2008\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:30a.m.-12:30p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n \t\t\tlifts 25-26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Brahim Bensaou (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Mounir Hamdi (Chairperson)\r\n                         Dr. Jogesh Muppala\r\n \t\t\tProf. Danny Tsang (ECE)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["On Congestion Control and Fair Bandwidth Allocation in the Internet"], "lenArticle": 417},

Examples of latent variable models \r\ninclude hidden Markov models (HMMs), latent class models, factor models, \r\nand so on. In this thesis we study a class of latent variable models known \r\nas latent tree (LT) models. LT models are tree-structured Bayesian \r\nnetworks where the leaf nodes represent manifest variables while internal \r\nnodes represent latent variables. We investigate the automatic induction \r\nof LT models from data, and the use of LT models in cluster analysis of \r\ncategorical data.\r\n\r\nSeveral search-based algorithms for learning LT models have been \r\ndeveloped. However there are important issues that remain poorly \r\nunderstood. In this thesis we study three such issues, namely operation \r\ngranularity, efficient model evaluation and range of model adjustment. The \r\ninvestigation sheds new light on search-based learning of LT models and \r\nleads to a new algorithm that is conceptually simpler and more efficient \r\nthan the state-of-the-art and yet finds better models.\r\n\r\nLT models can be used for latent structure discovery, density estimation \r\nand cluster analysis.

This proposal presents our initial investigations on \r\ncontinuous join queries in a data stream environment, which exhibit the \r\nfollowing two important properties. First, data characteristics, e.g., \r\narrival rates, value distributions, etc., may change in an unpredictable \r\nmanner. Consequently, the initial query plan may gradually become \r\ninefficient. This necessitates dynamic plan migration, an online \r\ntransition from the old plan to a new one generated based on current \r\nstatistics. In addition to correctness, an effective technique for this \r\npurpose should achieve the following objectives: (i) minimize the memory \r\nand CPU overhead of the migration (ii) reduce the duration of the \r\ntransition and (iii) maintain a steady output rate. The only known \r\nsolutions for this problem are the moving states (MS) and parallel track \r\n(PT) strategies, which have some serious shortcomings related to the above \r\nobjectives. Motivated by these shortcomings, we first propose HybMig, \r\nwhich combines the merits of MS and PT, and outperforms both on every \r\naspect.\r\n\r\nThe second key property of streaming a join query is that its data records \r\nare not available beforehand, but enter the system gradually. Hence, the \r\noperators in an execution plan need to be co-ordinated online, based on \r\ntuple arrivals and expirations. Specifically, these operators are \r\nconnected via the \u201cconsumer-producer\u201d relationship, i.e., the outputs of \r\none operator (the \u201cproducer\u201d) serve as the inputs to another (the \r\n\u201cconsumer\u201d). Conventional techniques execute each operator separately and \r\npush all results to its consumers, without considering whether the \r\nconsumers need them. As a result, considerable CPU and memory resources \r\nare wasted on producing and storing useless intermediate results. \r\nMotivated by this, we propose just-in-time (JIT) processing, a novel \r\nmethodology that enables a consumer to return feedback expressing its \r\ncurrent demand to the producer. The latter selectively generates outputs \r\nbased on this information. Besides achieving significant savings in terms \r\nof CPU time and memory consumption, JIT is compatible with to various \r\nsemantics including sliding windows and explicit deletions, and applies to \r\na broad range of execution plans, e.g., those involving shared operators, \r\nand/or using sophisticated architectures.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tWednesday, 17 December 2008\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:00a.m.-12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3588\r\n \t\t\tlifts 27-28\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Dimitris Papadias (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Wilfred Ng (Chairperson)\r\n                         Dr. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Join Algorithms for Non-Conventional Databases"], "lenArticle": 395},

To assist users in accessing and \r\nanalyzing contexts which capture the characteristics of the applications' \r\ncomputing environments, pervasive applications are deployed widely in a \r\nrichness and heterogeneity of resource-constrained devices. These \r\napplications are also featured by the context-awareness capability which \r\nenables applications to adapt to the ever-changing environments \r\ncontinually.

Like other applications, wireless sensor \r\nnetwork applications can be plagued by a variety of software faults. These \r\nfaults can be critical and costly in debugging and deployment of sensor \r\nnetworks. Furthermore, these WSN software faults are difficult to locate. \r\nTherefore, automatic fault localization before deployment can significantly \r\nreduce the cost of debugging and deployment of a sensor network system. In \r\ngeneral, debugging is composed of five steps: finding failure-triggering test \r\ncases, simplification of failed test cases, fault localization, repairing and \r\nregression testing. In another dimension, faults can reside in application \r\nlogic, driver of on-board device and networking. Among these dimensions, fault \r\nlocalization has been considered the most important step of debugging, and \r\napplication logic is more complex and bug-prone. We therefore focus on the \r\nstudy of fault localization of the application logic faults. In this thesis, \r\nfirst, an overview of the thesis will be presented. Then, WSN applications and \r\nautomatic fault localization techniques will be introduced. After that, based \r\non the state-of-art fault localization technique Tarantula, an adapted \r\nalgorithm has been proposed in order to increase its effectiveness. We also \r\nevaluated this algorithm by conducting controlled experiments. As a result, the \r\neffectiveness of Tarantula has been improved.

The advent of flash disks have the potential to \r\nbring the revolution to traditional storage devices. Nowadays, as their \r\ncapacity increases and price decreases, they are becoming more and more \r\nsuitable for comprehensive and complicated use. They are capable of \r\nproviding not only remarkable bandwidth, but also excellent random access \r\nperformance which is orders of magnitude better than magnetic disks. \r\nHowever, flash memory that used in flash disks has many unique \r\ncharacteristics that lead traditional data management algorithms designed \r\nfor magnetic disks perform badly with flash disks. More specifically, the \r\nsymmetric I/O that sequential(random) reads and sequential(random) writes \r\nhave the same speed no longer exists. In flash disks, while random reads \r\nhave the same speed as sequential reads, random writes and in-place \r\nupdates are orders of magnitude slower than sequential writes, and the \r\noverall read speed is much faster than write speed.\r\n\r\nThis survey discusses techniques that aim to fully utilize flash disks in \r\norder to further improve the efficiency of data management. Those \r\noptimizations are in different components of existing systems including \r\nstorage management, buffer management, transaction management, query \r\nprocessing, indexing and sorting.

The fundamental function of wireless sensor \r\nnetworks is the gathering of information from a covered area. Information \r\nthus gathered by the sensor nodes are processed by sink nodes according to \r\nthe applications deployed in the network. Therefore, delivering \r\ninformation from sensor nodes to sink nodes effectively is one of the \r\nfundamental challenges in wireless sensor networks. To achieve flexibility \r\nin deployment, sensor nodes are generally battery-driven. Furthermore, \r\nbattery replacement is very difficult due to the random deployment nature \r\nof wireless sensor networks. Thus, sensor nodes have limited operational \r\ntime and the operational time of the sensor networks is also limited. \r\nHence, energy efficiency is another fundamental challenge in wireless \r\nsensor networks. To improve the performance of wireless sensor networks, \r\ndata delivery in wireless sensor networks should be both energy efficient \r\nand effective, which is the focus of this thesis.\r\n\r\nFirst, we observe the conflict of the two objectives --viz., the \r\napplication performance and the network lifetime -- when optimizing the \r\nperformance of wireless sensor networks. We find that the tradeoff between \r\nthem can be studied by investigating the interaction between the network \r\nlifetime maximization problem and the rate allocation problem. Then, we \r\nformulate the tradeoff problem as a constrained convex optimization \r\nproblem by introducing a tradeoff factor. We first tackle this problem at \r\nthe transport layer, and then from a cross layer perspective. Using \r\nLagrange dual decomposition, algorithms are obtained to achieve the best \r\ntradeoff. Then, we note that the notion of reliability in certain wireless \r\nsensor networks is probabilistic. Based on this, the problem of providing \r\nminimum energy probabilistic reliable data delivery is studied. First we \r\ntackle the problem at the MAC layer, using p-persistent CSMA protocols. We \r\nderive adaptive algorithms to tune the persistence probability of these \r\np-persistent CSMA protocols. Then, we obtain the optimal allocation of \r\nper-hop reliability requirements for each sensor node, which further \r\nreduces the energy consumption with adaptive p-persistent CSMA protocols \r\nat the MAC layer.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 21 January 2009\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:30a.m.-12:30p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25-26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Amine Bermak (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Brahim Bensaou (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Mounir Hamdi\r\n \t\t\tProf. Jogesh Muppala\r\n \t\t\tProf. Danny Tsang (ECE)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Azzedine Boukerche (Comp.

In this \r\nthesis, two important issues about robust packet video transmission are \r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\nThe first issue is error resilient (ER) video compression. Motivated by \r\ntwo-hypothesis motion-compensated prediction (THMCP), we first propose an \r\nerror resilient video coding technique, where two-hypothesis and \r\none-hypothesis predictions are alternately used to encode the video \r\nstream. We use some schemes to determine which kind of prediction should \r\nbe used, so that in some cases of frame losses, the propagated error can \r\nbe first decreased to some extent before it spreads to the subsequent \r\nframes. Then we extend the previous work for THMCP to a more generalized \r\none, i.e. the reference frames can be some distance from the current \r\nframe, instead of only the immediately preceding ones. Three types of \r\nprediction patterns are proposed and implemented by the generalized B \r\npictures in H.264/AVC. In the case of a single frame loss during the \r\ntransmission, the induced error propagation is analyzed and the \r\nclosed-form expression for error energy is derived.\r\n\r\nThe second issue is error concealment (EC) for packet losses in video \r\ntransmission. We first propose an error concealment algorithm to \r\nreconstruct a lost INTER-frame in the odd/even temporal sub-sampling MDC. \r\nThe neighboring frames in the error-free stream are used to temporally \r\ninterpolate the lost frame, based the preserved motion vector in this \r\ncorrect stream. To further improve the reconstructed video quality after \r\nthe lost one, we also propose a multi-hypothesis error concealment (MHC) \r\nalgorithm. In addition to error-concealing the lost frame, MHC also \r\napplies temporal interpolation to some additional frames after the frame \r\nloss so as to reduce propagated error quickly. After discussing the EC \r\nalgorithms for INTER-frame losses, we propose two algorithms to \r\nerror-conceal a lost INTRA-frame. The novelty is that not only the \r\nINTRA-frame but also the subsequent INTER-frames are error concealed based \r\non the strong correlation between adjacent pixel values. In addition, \r\nmotion compensation is used to reconstruct the INTER-pixel which has an \r\nINTRA-pixel in its motion trajectory. Finally, we propose an edge-directed \r\nerror concealment algorithm to recover lost slices in FMO-encoded video. \r\nThe strong edges in a corrupted frame are estimated first, which are then \r\nused to direct the recovery of the structure regions and the remaining \r\nerroneous regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 22 January 2009\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00p.m.-4:00p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25-26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Vladimir Chigrinov (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Gary Chan (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Oscar Au (Supervisor, ECE)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Albert Chung\r\n \t\t\tProf. David Rossiter\r\n \t\t\tProf. Bertram Shi (ECE)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Nam Ling (Comp.

In such \r\napplications, WSNs are usually treated as the interface from which \r\napplications can obtain information of the underlying world. Different \r\napplications rely on different features of the WSNs, for example, an \r\nenvironmental surveillance network may need the locations to indicate the \r\nevents in the network. Among all the features, geometric properties and \r\ntopological information are two significant ones. A typical example of the \r\ntopological features is the boundary and hole information, which \r\ncharacterizes the perimeter and the void areas of a WSN. It plays as a \r\nfundamental element and indispensable input of WSN applications in various \r\nphases and aspects, such as deployment, sensing coverage, event detection, \r\ngeographical routing, navigation, and application-level functionalities. \r\nBoundary detection is thus a crucial issue but challenging as well, due to \r\nthe distributed infrastructure and resource-constrained nature of WSNs.\r\n\r\nIn this survey, we investigate the existing algorithms of boundary \r\ndetection in WSNs, and classify them with a novel taxonomy.

Since users in mobile computing environments enjoy unrestricted \nmobility and ubiquitous information access, location information, both \nabout the users and the data, is an important factor in data management. \nIn this paper, we investigate location-dependent cache management (LDCM) \ntechniques, which are very effective for enhancing data access performance \nin a mobile environment. Specifically, we discuss LDCM in two typical \nsystem environments. First, we consider a simple client-server model. A \nkey idea to overcome the constraints in mobile computing and to achieve \nhigh performance and scalability is to effectively utilize the \ncomputational and storage resources of the client machines. To this end, \ndata shipping methods have been proposed to allow query processing to be \nperformed largely at the clients with copies of data brought on-demand \nfrom servers into the clients. Therefore, caching becomes a critical \nfactor to improve query performance, e.g., by reducing latency and \nimproving data availability. Many ideas have been proposed to address the \nissues of LDCM. In particular, we discuss three key issues under the \nconstraints of location-dependent data, namely, cache validation, cache \nreplacement and query processing. Then, we further consider a more \ncomplicated model of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs), in which location \nrelations among clients are considered. In this way, location-dependent \ncaching can also provide better data organization to facilitate data \naccess.

It plays an \r\nimportant role in medical image analysis, group analysis and statistical \r\nparametric mapping. Particularly, medical image registration has attracted \r\nmany researchers over the past decades and become an active research \r\ntopic. Medical image registration can be broadly classified into two \r\ncategories: rigid and non-rigid image registration. They are classified \r\naccording to the transformation model adopted. More precisely, rigid image \r\nregistration uses the rigid transformation as the transformation model and \r\ntherefore it has six degrees of freedom. Non-rigid image registration \r\ntransforms one image to the other image via deformable transformation \r\nmodels such as B-spline basis function and free form deformation. \r\nNon-rigid image registration is more challenging than rigid image \r\nregistration as it has much higher degrees of freedom.\r\n\r\nIn this survey, we review and analyze three major classes of previous \r\napproaches proposed for non-rigid medical image registration: landmark \r\nbased, intensity based and feature based non-rigid image registration \r\nmethods.

With the introduction of relay node, \r\nwhich can forward packet for some other nodes which require relaying \r\nassistance, the network performance can be dramatically improved: the coverage \r\nof a infrastructure network is extended; spatial diversity is exploited and \r\nsystem capacity is increased; meanwhile, the transmission reliability is \r\nenhanced. In relay wireless networks, in order to fully exploit the benefit of \r\nrelay transmissions, MAC and network layer schemes need to be redesigned. In \r\nthis thesis, we will focus on the study of relay selection problem in MAC layer \r\nand optimal routing decision problem in network layer. Several relay and \r\nrouting selection schemes are proposed for different wireless applications when \r\nconcept of relaying is applied. In relay selection part, a cooperative MAC \r\nprotocol is designed to dynamically select relay nodes according to real-time \r\nchannel condition and contention relationship for broadcast traffics in \r\nvehicular networks; in respect to the cognitive radio networks, we propose a \r\nincentive relay set selection scheme to stimulate secondary users act as relay \r\nnodes to forward packets for secondary users; then, a cooperative cognitive \r\nradio architecture is proposed and a real testbed is constructed to verify its \r\neffectiveness. In routing selection part, a cooperative routing scheme which \r\nconsiders contention relationship among links is proposed in multi-source \r\nmulti-destination multi-hop wireless networks; and finally, a cooperative \r\nnetwork coding-aware routing scheme is given to enable relaying further enhance \r\nthe benefit of network coding in wireless networks.

Our work mainly focuses on four aspects: modelling uncertain \r\ninformation by vague sets, maintaining consistency in vague databases, \r\nextending SQL to query vague relations and mining vague association rules.\r\n\r\nModelling uncertain information by vague sets is the gravity of our work. We \r\ndiscuss how to measure vagueness in practice and the relationships between \r\nvague memberships and nulls. A new similarity measure of vague sets and the \r\nconcepts of median membership (m) and imprecision membership (i) are proposed. \r\nBased on these two memberships, we define the notions of mi-overlap, mi-union \r\nand mi-intersection between vague sets and the concepts of vague relations and \r\nvague databases.\r\n\r\nFunctional dependencies (FDs) and inclusion dependencies (INDs) are the most \r\nfundamental integrity constraints that arise in practice in relational \r\ndatabases. We utilize FDs and INDs to maintain the consistency of a vague \r\ndatabase. First, we tackle the problem, given a vague relation r and a set of \r\nFDs F, of how to obtain the \u201cbest\u201d approximation of r with respect to F when \r\ntaking into account the median membership and the imprecision membership \r\nthresholds. Using these two thresholds of a vague set, we define a merge \r\noperation on r. Second, we consider, given a vague database d and a set of INDs \r\nN, how to obtain the minimal possible change in value-precision for d. Finally, \r\nwe develop a vague chase procedure as a means to maintain consistency of d with \r\nrespect to F and N.\r\n\r\nIncorporating the notion of vague sets in relations, we propose vague SQL \r\n(VSQL), which is an extension of SQL for the vague relational model, and show \r\nthat VSQL com- bines the capabilities of a standard SQL with the power of \r\nmanipulating vague relations. Although VSQL is a minimal extension that \r\nillustrates its usages, VSQL allows users to formulate a wide range of queries \r\non vague data.\r\n\r\nUsing vague sets, we addresses the limitations of traditional association rule \r\n(AR) mining, which only discovers the hidden relationship among the items that \r\nhave been sold but ignores the items that are almost sold. For example, in many \r\nonline shopping applications, such as Amazon and eBay, those items that have \r\nbeen browsed in detail or put into the basket but are not checked out (almost \r\nsold items) carry hesitation information, since customers are hesitating to buy \r\nthem.

For example, if two categories of \r\nbusinesses often locate together, they might be identified as a \r\nco-location pattern; if several biologic species frequently live in nearby \r\nplaces, they might be a co-location pattern. There are a lot of spatial \r\ndata in real world, from which we can find co-location patterns, such as \r\nGPS logs, yellow pages, and map search logs. Co-location patterns have \r\nmany useful applications. For example, the co-located query patterns, \r\nwhich are subsets of queries often searched for close target locations, \r\ncan be used in location sensitive query suggestion, Point of interest \r\nrecommendation, and local advertising.\r\n\r\nWith the purpose of mining co-location patterns in real data, we find \r\nexisting approaches have two problems. First, they only find global \r\nco-location patterns. The regional co-location patterns they miss are also \r\ninteresting and potentially useful. Second, they are not scalable to large \r\ndata sets due to huge number of candidates and expensive instance \r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nIn order address these problems, we propose three co-location pattern \r\ndiscovery approaches. First, we propose a lattice based co-location \r\npattern discovery approach (LatticeCLPMiner). This approach can find both \r\nregional and global co-location patterns, distinguish regional patterns \r\nfrom global co-location ones, and find the applicable areas of regional \r\npatterns. Second, we propose a density based approach (DenseCLPMiner) to \r\nspeedup co-location pattern mining. DenseCLPMiner utilizes the non-uniform \r\ndistribution of spatial objects. It processes the dense areas first to \r\ngenerate instances of candidates, maintains the upper bounds of the \r\nprevalence of candidates using the generated instances in already \r\nprocessed partitions, and prune the candidates in the event that their \r\nprevalence upper bounds fall below a threshold. As a result, the overall \r\ncost of instance generation is reduced. Third, we propose a bitmap based \r\ncandidate pruning technique (BitmapPruner) that speedups co-location \r\npattern mining. We provide an approximate prevalence measurement and \r\ndefine approximate co-location patterns. We propose a bitmap structure to \r\nquickly discover approximate patterns. If a candidate is not an \r\napproximate pattern, we prune it immediately without entering the costly \r\ninstance generation step. Due to the lightweighted and effective pruning \r\ntechnique, we improve the efficiency of existing co-location pattern \r\ndiscovery approaches.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tFriday, 17 April 2009\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:30a.m.-12:30p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 4480\r\n \t\t\tlifts 25-26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Qiong Luo (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Wei-Ying Ma (Supervisor, Microsoft Research)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dik-Lun Lee (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Frederick Lochovsky\r\n \t\t\tDr. Wilfred Ng\r\n \t\t\tDr. Xing Xie (Microsoft Research)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["CO-LOCATION PATTERN DISCOVERY"], "lenArticle": 422},

Due \r\nto the explosive increase in size and complexity of the data, the analysis \r\ntasks involved pose difficult problems. Volume visualization provides an \r\neffective solution which aims at delivering insights of the underlying details \r\nor concepts by the means of computer graphics for creating useful views on the \r\ndata. In fact, effective visualization requires the support of intuitive and \r\ninteractive exploration techniques as well as proper rendering and presentation \r\nof the data in order to facilitate the users in acquiring insights and useful \r\ninformation from the volumes. This proposal focuses on the improvement of the \r\nrendered image quality and the exploration pipeline to facilitate the \r\nvisualization process.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, we first present two exploration techniques for visualizing \r\nvolumetric data. Instead of performing tedious manipulation on the volumes, we \r\nsuggest a quality-driven camera path planning method and a relation-aware \r\nvisualization pipeline to allow semi-automatic exploration of volumes. Volume \r\nfeatures and high-level spatial relations are considered to determine the \r\nproper views on the volumes and our objective is to reveal this important \r\ninformation using the proposed visualization techniques. In the second part, \r\nthe issues of rendered image quality are discussed and we propose two image \r\nquality enhancement approaches to ensure that the features in the volume are \r\nfaithfully presented in the rendered images and correct perception of the \r\nvolumes is obtained by viewers. An adaptive enhancement framework is also \r\nproposed to adjust the rendering parameters for obtaining optimal rendered \r\nimages.

Because of the occlusion of 3D objects, revealing all these \r\nstructures and their 3D spatial relations simultaneously is very \r\nchallenging. Direct Volume Rendering is a powerful volume visualization \r\nmethod which allows users to visually explore the volume datasets in a \r\nhighly flexible manner. Despite the powerful capability of direct volume \r\nrendering for exploring volume data, its inherent complexity of specifying \r\nrendering parameters often results in a tedious and non-intuitive \r\nvisualization process. In addition, because of its complicated ray casting \r\nand compositing process, its results (i.e., Direct Volume Rendered \r\nImages)\u00a0usually contain some misleading information such as artifacts and \r\ndepth ambiguity, which makes the visualization unreliable\u00a0and ineffective \r\nfor volume exploration.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis proposal, we present three methods for improving the \r\nintuitiveness and effectiveness of direct volume rendering as follows.\r\n1). An editing framework for direct volume rendered images, allowing users to \r\ninteractively explore complex volumetric datasets by directly editing \r\ndirect volume rendered images. Users can intuitively fuse multiple \r\nfeatures in distinct direct volume rendered images, remove any feature \r\nfrom a direct volume rendered image, or blend two direct volume rendered \r\nimages.\r\n2).

However, most of the existing works focus on search \r\nover static graph databases while in many real applications graphs are \r\nchanging over time. In this thesis we investigate a new problem on \r\ncontinuous subgraph pattern search under the situation where multiple \r\ntarget graphs are constantly changing in a stream style, namely the \r\nsubgraph pattern search over graph streams. Obviously the proposed problem \r\nis a continuous join between query patterns and graph streams where the \r\njoin predicate is the existence of subgraph isomorphism. Due to the \r\nNP-completeness of subgraph isomorphism checking, to achieve the real-time \r\nmonitoring of the existence of certain subgraph patterns, we would like to \r\navoid using subgraph isomorphism verification to find the exact \r\nquery-stream subgraph isomorphic pairs but to offer an approximate answer \r\nthat could report all probable pairs without missing any actual answer \r\npairs. Therefore, we propose a light-weight yet effective feature \r\nstructure called Node-Neighbor Tree to filter out false candidate \r\nquery-stream pairs. To reduce the computational cost, we propose a novel \r\nidea, projecting the feature structures into a numerical vector space and \r\nconducting dominant relationship checking in the projected space. We \r\ndesign two methods to efficiently verify dominant relationships, and thus \r\nanswer the subgraph search over graph streams efficiently.  In addition to \r\nanswering queries over certain graph streams, we propose a novel problem, \r\ndetecting the appearance of subgraph patterns over uncertain graph streams \r\nwith high probability (i.e. larger than the probability threshold \r\nspecified by users). To address this problem, we not only extend the \r\nproposed solutions for certain graphs streams, but also propose a new \r\npruning technique by utilizing the probability threshold.

However, writes, especially random writes, on the \r\nflash disk are inherently much slower than reads because of the \r\nerase-before-write mechanism. To address this asymmetry of read-write \r\nspeeds in indexing on the flash disk, we propose the FD-tree, a tree index \r\ndesigned with the logarithmic method and fractional cascading techniques. \r\nWith the logarithmic method, an FD-tree consists of the head tree -- a \r\nsmall B+-tree on the top, and a few levels of sorted runs of increasing \r\nsizes at the bottom. This design is write-optimized for the flash disk; in \r\nparticular, an index search will potentially go through more levels or \r\nvisit more nodes, but random writes are limited to a small area -- the \r\nhead tree, and are subsequently transformed into sequential ones through \r\nmerging into the lower runs. With the fractional cascading technique, we \r\nstore pointers, called fences, in lower level runs to speed up the search. \r\nGiven a FD-tree of n entries, we analytically show that it supports \r\nupdates in O(logBn) sequential I/Os and preserve the search efficiency in \r\nO(logBn)random I/Os, where B is the page size. We evaluate the FD-tree in \r\ncomparison with representative B+-tree variants under a variety of \r\nworkloads on both mid-class and high-end flash SSDs. Our results show that \r\nthe FD-tree has a similar search performance to the standard B+-tree, and \r\na similar update performance to the write-optimized B+-tree variant.

Camera blur and noise are two major types of defect. \r\nEnhancement of image and video is an important topic in computer vision \r\nand graphics, because it can serve as either a pre-processing step for \r\nother algorithms, or a post-processing step for directly enhanceing the \r\noutput for users.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, I will explore pertinent issues in visual enhancement, \r\nespecially for blur and noise, and propose viable solutions to address the \r\nproblem. While most traditional works mainly use a single image for the \r\npurpose of enhancement, I will focus on the usage of multiple \r\nobservations. While more observations give us more information, many \r\nresearch challenges make the problem difficult. First of all, it is \r\nimportant to construct and collect multiple observations properly. Second, \r\nthe observations should be appropriately utilized in a computational \r\nframework. A unified multi-observation enhancement approach is presented \r\nin this proposal, where we emphasize the importance of invariance in \r\nlinking multiple observations. We will also derive specific optimization \r\nprocedures integrating prior knowledge with these observations.\r\n\r\nI will first analyze the image deblurring problem using two observations. \r\nGiven that the two inputs are taken from the same static scene, the \r\ninvariance is the common clear image. Since the two inputs have different \r\nmotion blur artifacts, their frequency responses are complementary to each \r\nother. A feedback algorithm is proposed which effectively combines two \r\nindependent input blurred images. This approach introduces image prior and \r\nmotion prior in the context of multiple observations. The visual quality \r\nof enhancement can be significantly improved compared to approaches using \r\nsingle images.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this proposal will focus on the denoising problem. \r\nRemoving noise from image is a topic that has been studied for decades. \r\nHowever, there are limitations from most previous automatic approaches \r\nwhere they usually take the image itself as the processing target.  We \r\nshow that even with a single input image, an auxiliary observation, namely \r\nthe noise layer, can be constructed.

Clients direct their queries to the\r\nprovider, without contacting the owner. The provider is considered\r\nuntrustworthy and may tamper with the results. Authenticated query\r\nprocessing allows the owner to cryptographically ??mark?? its dataset\r\nthrough a public-key cryptosystem, and the provider to associate a proof\r\nof correctness with the returned results. This proof is usually generated\r\nby authenticated data structures (ADSs), which are similar to traditional\r\nindices, but they are augmented with cryptographic information. The\r\nclients can efficiently verify the proof using the public key of the\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal we study two important problems in database outsourcing:\r\n(i) spatial authentication, and (ii) continuous authentication on\r\nrelational streams. Regarding the first topic, we introduce the MR-tree, a\r\nspace-efficient ADS that supports fast processing and verification of\r\nspatial queries (e.g., ranges, nearest neighbor queries, etc.). The\r\nMR-Tree outperforms the existing solutions on all performance metrics. We\r\nthen design the MR*-tree, a modified version of the MR-tree, which\r\nsignificantly reduces the proof size through a novel embedding technique.\r\nFinally, whereas most ADSs must be constructed and maintained also by the\r\nowner, we outsource the MR- and MR*-tree construction and maintenance to\r\nthe server, thus relieving the owner from this computationally intensive\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nConcerning the second problem, we first address the challenges posed by\r\nstream environments, such as the need for fast structure updating, support\r\nfor continuous query processing and authentication, and provision for\r\ntemporal completeness. Specifically, in addition to the correctness of\r\nindividual results, the client must be able to verify that there are no\r\nmissing results in between data updates. Then we present a comprehensive\r\nset of methods covering relational streams, including the following: (i)\r\nWe describe REF, a technique that provides result correctness and temporal\r\ncompleteness but incurs false transmissions, i.e., the server has to\r\ninform the clients whenever there is a data update, even if their results\r\nare not affected. (ii) We propose CADS, which minimizes the processing and\r\ntransmission overhead through an elaborate indexing scheme and a virtual\r\ncaching mechanism. (iii) We include an analytical study to determine the\r\noptimal indexing granularity. (iv) We extend CADS for the case that the\r\ndata distribution changes over time. Finally, we evaluate the\r\neffectiveness of our techniques through extensive experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tMonday, 22 June 2009\r\n\r\nTime:                   3:00pm-5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n \t\t\tlifts 25-26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Dimitris Papadias (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Mounir Hamdi (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dik-Lun Lee\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Authenticated Query Processing"], "lenArticle": 440},

Previous works have achieved dramatic progress, yet the \r\nheavy ill-posedness of the problem leads to the results still far from perfect. \r\nIn my thesis, I will explore latent and valuable information (or prior) from \r\nobservations to provide a good condition for image deblurring.\r\n\r\nThe first idea comes from the help of additional correlative images. By \r\ncombining information between blurred image and noisy image pair, we can \r\nestimate a very accurate blur kernel and restore a high-quality original image, \r\nwhich can not be obtained by simple single image denoising or single image \r\ndeblurring. The idea further pushes me to develop a more general framework for \r\nimage deblurring with a sequence of images, which do not limit to blurred/noisy \r\nimage pair, and even can be multiple blurred image pairs. Our approach lies on \r\nthe assumption that these blurred images with different blurs are derived from \r\nthe same original image and different blurs will result in the loss of \r\ndifferent frequency components during imaging. By integrating these \r\ncomplementary information together, we can see the addition of extra \r\ncorrelative image pairs can further eliminate ambiguous solutions in kernel \r\nestimation and image restoration. Furthermore, a prominent problem in multiple \r\nimage deblurring is how well image pairs can be aligned. We then proposed a \r\nfully automatic alignment approach for multiple image pairs using sparseness \r\nprior of the blur kernel. Thus our methods are very practical and effective for \r\nachieving satisfactory photos in dim light conditions using off-of-shelf \r\nhand-held camera. The second idea is from the prior of sharp image structure. \r\nIn our image deblurring with blurred/noisy image pair, the noisy image provides \r\nlarge-scale and sharp structures for accurate kernel estimation and \r\nhigh-quality image restoration as the guide image. I will show this insight can \r\nbe furthermore applied to single image deblurring. As we observed, the \r\nreconstructed image usually contains unpleasant artifacts, i.e. ringing, due to \r\nthe ill-posedness of the deconvolution even if the blur kernel is known. To \r\nsuppress ringing artifacts and preserve restored structures, we require the \r\nguide image to tell where edges and texture regions are, and where flat regions \r\nare. Thus, we develop an inter-scale and intra-scale deconvolution framework to \r\nprogressively recover such a guide image, which is used to adaptively suppress \r\nartifacts in texture regions and flat regions. Our progressive deconvolution \r\napproach can produce very promising results not only in synthetic experiments, \r\nbut also in various types of real cases. Our results show our approach \r\noutperforms other state-of-the-art techniques and have wide applications in \r\nscientific and daily areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tMonday, 22 June 2009\r\n\r\nTime:                   3:30pm-5:30pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 4483\r\n \t\t\tlifts 25-26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Long Quan (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Chi-Keung Tang (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Huamin Qu\r\n \t\t\tDr. Chiew-Lan Tai\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Image Deblurring using Extra Image Pairs and Sharp Structure Priors"], "lenArticle": 486},

Recent research has explored issues on querying different types of \r\nmeta-data associated with an XML document, including annotations, quality \r\nassessments, security policies, etc. The meta-data considered by many of these \r\napproaches can be modeled as values from a totally ordered domain (e.g. recency \r\nusing timestamps). A natural model for annotating XML data with meta-data is to \r\nassociate meta-data explicitly only with selected element nodes in the XML data \r\ntree. For elements where the meta-data is not explicitly specified, it is \r\ninherited from the nearest ancestor where it is explicitly specified. We show \r\nthat such a meta-data model can be converted to a 3-sided 2D range query \r\nproblem. Thus, we present an external binary priority search which is a data \r\nstructure for querying XML with inherited attributes I/O-efficiently.

My PhD research focuses on join processing in two categories of \r\nnovel applications. The first is continuous joins in data streams. \r\nSpecifically, I exploit two key properties of the streaming join. First, \r\nthe initial plan of a long query may gradually become inefficient due to \r\nchanges in data characteristics. This necessitates dynamic plan migration, \r\nan online transition from the old plan to a more efficient one generated \r\nbased on current statistics. The only known solutions MS and PT have some \r\nserious shortcomings. Hence, I propose HybMig, which combines their \r\nmerits, and outperforms them on every aspect.\r\n\r\nThe second important property is that an output tuple from an upstream \r\njoin (called the producer) may never generate any result in downstream \r\noperators (the consumers) during its entire lifespan. Motivated by this, I \r\npropose just-in-time (JIT) processing, a novel methodology that enables a \r\nproducer to selectively generate outputs based on feedback returned from \r\nconsumers that express their current demand. Extensive experiments show \r\nthat JIT achieves significant savings in terms of both CPU time and memory \r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nThe second class of joins in this thesis are authenticated ones in \r\noutsourced databases. In particular, database outsourcing requires that \r\nthe query server constructs a proof of result correctness, which can be \r\nverified by the client using the data owner\u2019s signature. Addressing such \r\nqueries, I propose a comprehensive set of new solutions that cover the \r\nentire spectrum of index availability. Furthermore, I extend them to \r\nauthenticate complex queries, involving multi-way joins and other \r\nrelational operators.

In the layered design of \r\nthe TCP/IP architecture, the Network Layer only provides best-effort packet \r\ndelivery service, while the efficiency and fairness are relinquished to the \r\ncongestion control mechanism implemented in the Transport Layer of the end \r\nsystems. The TCP congestion control algorithm originally designed for the \r\nhomogenous wired network is facing great challenges in the ever changing and \r\nmore heterogeneous Internet. For example, conventional TCP cannot perform well \r\nin networks with high bandwidth-delay product or in wireless networks with \r\nnon-congestion-related packet losses. On the other hand, designed for packet \r\nrouting, IP networks are vulnerable to misbehaving end systems. Quality of \r\nService (QoS) enhancements on IP networks have been proposed for decades yet \r\nthey still are not deployed widely due to their complexity. With the current \r\nscale of the Internet, any radical changes to the TCP/IP protocol stack are \r\nunlikely. Simple but effective enhancements involving modifications in only one \r\npart of the Internet, either the end systems or the intermediate routers, seem \r\nto be more practical.\r\n\r\nThis thesis focuses on congestion control and fair bandwidth allocation issues \r\nin the Internet and discusses how the intermediate routers or the end systems \r\ncan be enhanced to adapt to the heterogeneous Internet. More specifically, we \r\nstudy the performance of TCP protocols in high-speed networks with the emphasis \r\non how the synchronized loss effect affects the fairness principle achieved by \r\nmany newly proposed TCP variants in high-speed networks. We also investigate \r\nthe issue of taming misbehaving flows in the IP networks. We propose a new \r\nlow-cost AQM scheme, SiFTM, to provide better intra-and inter-protocol fairness \r\nto support heterogeneous transmission protocols. SiFTM can prevent end users \r\nfrom acting intrusively thus promoting end-to-end congestion control \r\nmechanisms. Finally we study the TCP performance in IEEE 802.11 WLAN which is \r\ncurrently the most popular wireless network application in the Internet.

Parallel coordinates and \r\ngraphs are two well-established methods in information visualization. \r\nHowever, when data become very large, the effectiveness of both methods is \r\ndramatically reduced as tens of thousands of lines can easily overwhelm \r\nthe display and the resulting visual clutter will obscure any underlying \r\npatterns. Thus, clutter reduction for parallel coordinates and graphs is a \r\nvery important research problem in information visualization.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we introduce visual clustering as a new approach for \r\nclutter reduction and pattern detection. Compared with traditional clutter \r\nreduction methods such as filtering and brushing, visual clustering can \r\nenhance and reveal interesting patterns in the data while preserving the \r\ncontext.  For parallel coordinates, we present a force-based optimization \r\nmethod to bundle polylines by adjusting their shapes, and a splatting \r\nframework to reveal features with animations.

Given a collection of data sampled from \r\nan unknown distribution, the task is to approximately reconstruct the \r\ngenerative distribution. There are two different approaches to the \r\nproblem, the parametric approach and the non-parametric approach. In the \r\nparametric approach, the approximate distribution is represented by a \r\nmodel from a predetermined family.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we adopt the parametric approach and investigate the use \r\nof a model family called latent tree models for the task of density \r\nestimation. Latent tree models are tree-structured Bayesian networks in \r\nwhich leaf nodes represent observed variables, while internal nodes \r\nrepresent hidden variables. Such models can represent complex \r\nrelationships among observed variables, and in the meantime, admit \r\nefficient inference among them.  Consequently, they are a desirable tool \r\nfor density estimation.\r\n\r\nWhile latent tree models are studied for the first time in this thesis for \r\nthe purpose of density estimation, they have been investigated earlier for \r\nclustering and latent structure discovery. Several algorithms for learning \r\nlatent tree models have been proposed. The state-of-the-art is an \r\nalgorithm called EAST.  EAST determines model structures through \r\nprincipled and systematic search, and determines model parameters using \r\nthe EM algorithm. It has been shown to be capable of achieving good \r\ntrade-off between fit to data and model complexity. It is also capable of \r\ndiscovering latent structures behind data. Unfortunately, it has a high \r\ncomputational complexity, which limits its applicability to density \r\nestimation problems.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we propose two latent tree model learning algorithms \r\nspecifically for density estimation. The two algorithms have distinct \r\ncharacteristics and are suitable for different applications. The first \r\nalgorithm is called HCL. HCL assumes a predetermined bound on model \r\ncomplexity and restricts to binary model structures. It first builds a \r\nbinary tree structure based on mutual information and then runs the EM \r\nalgorithm once on the resulting structure to determine the parameters. As \r\nsuch, it is efficient and can deal with large applications.  The second \r\nalgorithm is called Pyramid. Pyramid does not assume predetermined bounds \r\non model complexity and does not restrict to binary tree structures. It \r\nbuilds model structures using heuristics based on mutual information and \r\nlocal search.  It is slower than HCL. However, it is faster than EAST and \r\nis only slightly inferior to EAST in terms of the quality of the resulting \r\nmodels.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we also study two applications of the density estimation \r\ntechniques that we develop. The first application is to approximate \r\nprobabilistic inference in Bayesian networks. A Bayesian network \r\nrepresents a joint distribution over a set of random variables. It often \r\nhappens that the network structure is very complex and making inference \r\ndirectly on the network is computational intractable. We propose to \r\napproximate the joint distribution using a latent tree model and exploit \r\nthe latent tree model for faster inference. The idea is to sample data \r\nfrom the Bayesian network, learn a latent tree model from the data \r\noffline, and when online, make inference with the latent tree model \r\ninstead of the original Bayesian network.  HCL is used here because the \r\nsample size needs to be large to produce accurate approximation and it is \r\npossible to predetermine a bound on the online running. Empirical evidence \r\nshows that this method can achieve good approximation accuracy at low \r\nonline computational cost.\r\n\r\nThe second application is classification.  A common approach to this task \r\nis to formulate it as a density estimation problem: One constructs the \r\nclass-conditional density for each class and then uses the Bayes rule to \r\nmake classification. We propose to estimate those class-conditional \r\ndensities using either EAST or Pyramid. Empirical evidence shows that this \r\nmethod yields good classification performances.  Moreover, the latent tree \r\nmodels built for the class-conditional densities are often meaningful, \r\nwhich is conducive to user confidence. A comparison between EAST and \r\nPyramid reveals that Pyramid is significantly more efficient than EAST, \r\nwhile it results in more or less the same classification performance as \r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 18 August 2009\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm-4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25-26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Hai Yang (CIVL)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Nevin Zhang (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Brian Mak\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung\r\n \t\t\tProf. Ning Cai (IELM)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Marek Druzdzel (Inf.

With the introduction of relay node, \r\nwhich can forward packet for some other nodes which require relaying \r\nassistance, the network performance can be dramatically improved: the coverage \r\nof an infrastructure network is extended; spatial diversity is exploited and \r\nsystem capacity is increased; meanwhile, the transmission reliability is \r\nenhanced. In relay wireless networks, in order to fully exploit the benefit of \r\nrelay transmissions, MAC and network layer schemes need to be redesigned. In \r\nthis thesis, we will focus on the study of relay selection problem in MAC layer \r\nand optimal routing decision problem in network layer. Several relay and \r\nrouting selection schemes are proposed for different wireless applications when \r\nconcept of relaying is applied. In relay selection part, a cooperative MAC \r\nprotocol is designed to dynamically select relay nodes according to real-time \r\nchannel condition and contention relationship for broadcast traffics in \r\nvehicular networks; in respect to the cognitive radio networks, a relay-based \r\ncognitive radio architecture is proposed to balance the spectrum availability \r\nand traffic demand for secondary users, an experimental testbed is constructed \r\nto verify its effectiveness; we also propose an incentive relay set selection \r\nscheme to motivate secondary users to act as cooperative relays to forward \r\npackets for primary users. In routing selection part, a cooperative routing \r\nscheme which considers contention relationship among links is proposed in \r\nmulti-source multi-destination multi-hop wireless networks; a cooperative \r\nnetwork coding-aware routing scheme is given to enable relaying to further \r\nenhance the benefit of network coding in wireless networks.

For example, map search queries, \r\nwhich contain keywords in text as well as target locations on the map, can be \r\nmined for co-located query patterns, i.e., sets of keyword queries that often \r\nsearch for target locations near one another. Such co-located query patterns \r\ncan be used in location sensitive query suggestion, Point of Interest (POI) \r\nrecommendation, and local advertising.\r\n\r\nThis thesis investigates ways to improve the efficiency of co-location mining \r\nfor large data sets, e.g., million-entry map search query logs. In particular, \r\nwe improve the efficiency of the generate-and-test method, which is commonly \r\nused in co-location mining. This method iteratively generates instances of \r\ncandidate patterns, tests and prunes the false candidates.\r\n\r\nThrough experiments, we find that the major problem in generate-and-test is the \r\nexcessive number of instances generated for false candidates. This problem \r\ncauses both the instance generation and the pruning steps to take an \r\nunnecessarily long time. Therefore, we propose two orthogonal approaches, \r\nDenseMiner and BitmapMiner, to address the problem on instance generation and \r\non pruning respectively.\r\n\r\nDenseMiner partitions the geographic area of objects and processes the \r\npartitions that contain a high density of objects first. This approach works \r\nwell because the spatial distributions of real-world objects are usually \r\nnon-uniform.  As a result, processing the dense areas first often identifies \r\nfalse candidates early on and avoids generating the instances of these false \r\ncandidates in the other areas.\r\n\r\nBitmapMiner also partitions objects by their geographical locations. It further \r\nutilizes a bitmap structure to represent the neighboring relationship between \r\nclasses of objects. The cell size for the bitmap structure is set based on the \r\noverall density of the objects. The candidate pruning in each cell can be done \r\non a per-object basis, on a per-cell basis, or in an adaptive, multi-resolution \r\nway to match the spatial distribution of the objects in the cell. Consequently, \r\nwe test and prune false candidates efficiently based on the bitmaps.\r\n\r\nWe have conducted experiments on both synthetic data sets and real-world data \r\nsets. The experimental results show that our proposed approaches improve the \r\nexecution time by up to an order of magnitude over prior work.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 20 August 2009\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25-26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. David Lam (MECH)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Qiong Luo (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Wei-Ying Ma (Supervisor, Microsoft Research Asia)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dik-Lun Lee\r\n \t\t\tProf. Wilfred Ng\r\n \t\t\tProf. Jiang Xu (ECE)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Jeffrey Yu (Sys.

With text preprocessing (document representation) \r\ntechnologies, this thesis makes use of this kind of data, specifically \r\nfinancial news articles, to apply data mining in financial market \r\npredictions.\r\n\r\nA web-based system has been developed for this purpose. It retrieves \r\nfinancial news articles from the internet periodically and using text \r\nmining techniques to categorize those articles into different categories \r\naccording to their expected effects on the market behaviors, then the \r\nresults will be compared with the real market data. The system allows the \r\nusers to select different algorithms for each phase of the text mining \r\nprocess, so that the results for different combinations of algorithms can \r\nbe compared and the best one can be selected by observing the results. \r\nThis combination of algorithms can be applied to do financial market \r\nprediction in the future.\r\n\r\nThe text mining process has three phases totally, keyword extraction, \r\nkeyword weighting and classification. Keyword extraction is to extract a \r\nkeyword list from a corpus, according to the ability of each word to \r\ndistinguish the category of a document from others. The system has \r\nimplemented the following keyword extraction algorithms: document \r\nfrequency threshold, entropy method, information gain, gain ratio, \r\nchi-square statistic and mutual information. Keyword weighting is to \r\ntransform a document into a numeric feature vector according to a keyword \r\nlist generated previously. Each word in the keyword list will be assigned \r\na weight according to the number of occurrence of this keyword in a \r\ndocument. The system has implemented Boolean weighting, term frequency \r\n(TF) weighting, term frequency times inverse document frequency weighting \r\n(TFxIDF), LTC weighting and TFC weighting methods. For classification \r\nalgorithms, this system has implemented Navie Bayes Classifier and Support \r\nVector Machines, but the experiment is focused on the former classifier.\r\n\r\nThe system collected news articles and market data and was tested to \r\ncompare different algorithms for each phase. As there are a huge amount of \r\ncombinations of different algorithms, we adopted a greedy approach to find \r\nout the optimized combination. Particularly, we vary the algorithms or \r\nparameters for one phase of the text mining, and fix all the others. Then \r\nby observing the results, select the best algorithm/parameter and assume \r\nthat it is also the global optimized algorithm for this phase no matter \r\nhow the algorithms/parameters of other phases vary. The results are \r\npresented and analyzed in this thesis for selecting the best combination \r\nof algorithms for text mining in financial market prediction.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 20 August 2009\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25-26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. David Rossiter (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Financial Market Predictions using Web Mining Approaches"], "lenArticle": 537},

Current SMT systems attempts to tackle adequacy primarily by \r\nmemorizing in a bi-lexicon all word (or phrase) translation pairs that co-occur \r\nfrequently in a training corpus, using various statistics with the hope of \r\nimproving the accuracy of translation lexical choice. They model the word order \r\nin the translation output as a statistical dependency problem, relying heavily \r\non monolingual n-gram language models of the output language in an attempt to \r\ncompensate for weak bilingual models of word (or phrase) alignment and \r\npermutation. Since no semantic features are considered throughout the process \r\nof training and translating, it is not surprising that serious semantic role \r\nconfusion errors appear in the SMT output. To tackle this problem, one approach \r\nis to integrate semantic information into SMT.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we study in detail a state-of-the-art Chinese shallow semantic parser, \r\nC-ASSERT, which consists of a Chinese word segmenter and a Chinese shallow \r\nsyntactic parser, is studied in detail. A set of controlled experiments is \r\ncarried out by using different Chinese word segmenters and Chinese shallow \r\nsyntactic parsers. It is found that the best performance is obtained when the \r\nChinese word segmenter and the Chinese shallow syntactic parser are both the \r\nmaximum entropy model built by our research center at HKUST.\r\n\r\nThen, to provide solid groundwork to support our claim that using Semantic Role \r\nLabels (SRL) to reorder SMT output improves translation quality, a strong SMT \r\nbaseline is set up and optimized.\r\n\r\nAn objective scoring function is then devised to quantify the matching of \r\nshallow semantic role between the Chinese source input and the SMT output. \r\nFinally, an algorithm is built to reorder the SMT output using semantic role \r\nlabels. The experiment results show that the algorithm successfully returns a \r\nbetter translation with fewer semantic role confusion errors.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 24 August 2009\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3301A\r\n \t\t\tLifts 17-18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Dekai Wu (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Brian Mak (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Pascale Fung (ECE)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Using Semantic Role Labels to Reorder Statistical Machine Translation Output"], "lenArticle": 380},

Previous works have achieved dramatic \r\nprogress, yet the heavy ill-posedness of the problem leads to the results \r\nstill far from perfect. In my thesis, I will explore valuable information \r\nor latent priors from observations to provide a better condition for image \r\ndeblurring.\r\n\r\nThe first idea is to take advantage of additional correlated images. By \r\ncombining information between two degraded images \u2013 blurred/noisy image \r\npair, we can estimate a very accurate blur kernel and restore a \r\nhigh-quality original image, which cannot be obtained by simple single \r\nimage denoising or single image deblurring. The idea further pushes me to \r\ndevelop a more general framework for image deblurring with a sequence of \r\nimages, which do not limit to blurred/noisy image pair, and even can be \r\nmultiple blurred images. Our approach is based on the assumption that \r\nthese blurred images with different blurs which are derived from the same \r\noriginal image and different blurs will result in the loss of different \r\nfrequency components during imaging. By integrating these complementary \r\ninformation together, we can see these additional correlated images can \r\nfurther eliminate ambiguous solutions in both kernel estimation and image \r\nrestoration. Furthermore, a prominent problem in image deblurring with \r\nmultiple images is how well image pairs can be aligned. We then proposed a \r\nfully automatic alignment approach for multiple images using the \r\nsparseness prior of blur kernels. Thus our methods are very practical and \r\neffective for achieving satisfactory photos in dim light conditions using \r\noff-of-shelf hand-held camera.\r\n\r\nThe second idea is to make use of the prior of sharp image structure. In \r\nour image deblurring with blurred/noisy image pair, the noisy image as the \r\nguide image provides sharp large-scale edges for accurate kernel \r\nestimation and high-quality image restoration. I will show this insight \r\ncan be furthermore applied to single image deblurring. As we observed, the \r\nreconstructed image usually contains unpleasant artifacts, i.e. ringing, \r\ndue to the ill-posedness of image deconvolution even if the blur kernel is \r\nknown. To suppress ringing artifacts and preserve recovered signals, we \r\nrequire the guide image to tell where edges and texture regions are, and \r\nwhere flat regions are. Thus, we develop an inter-scale and intra-scale \r\ndeconvolution framework to progressively recover such a guide image, which \r\nis then used to adaptively suppress artifacts in texture regions and flat \r\nregions. Our progressive deconvolution approach can produce very promising \r\nresults not only in synthetic experiments, but also in various types of \r\nreal cases. Our results show our approach outperforms other \r\nstate-of-the-art techniques and have wide applications in scientific and \r\ndaily areas\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 24 August 2009\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm-4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25-26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Tongxi Yu (MECH)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Long Quan (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Chiew-Lan Tai\r\n \t\t\tProf. Chi-Keung Tang\r\n \t\t\tProf. Bing Zeng (ECE)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Tien-Tsin Wong (Comp.

Two major \r\ntypes of defects are blur and noise. Enhancement of image and video is an \r\nimportant topic in computer vision and graphics, because it can serve \r\neither as a pre-processing step for other algorithms or as a \r\npost-processing step to directly produce enhanced output for users.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, I will explore the issues and propose solutions to visual \r\nenhancement given images corrupted by blur and noise. There are a great \r\nnumber of previous works and most of them use a single image for the \r\npurpose of enhancement. This thesis will study the problem from a \r\ndifferent perspective: using multiple cues for visual enhancement. \r\nDifferent ways are proposed to construct useful cues in addition to the \r\nsource image itself. In deblurring, we introduce one more shot thus \r\nconverting the deblurring problem from using a single image to using two \r\nimages. In denoising problem, we use the noise layer as well as the noisy \r\nimage for image noise removal. We formulate video denoising by optimizing \r\none frame with multiple temporal observations.\r\n\r\nWhile it is intuitive that using multiple cues will provide us with more \r\ninformation for enhancement, many research challenges remain to be solved. \r\nFirst of all, it is important to construct and collect multiple cues in \r\nproper ways. Second, the observations should be linked in a computational \r\nframework. The theme of this thesis is centered at a unified multi-cue \r\nenhancement approach, where we emphasize the importance of invariant \r\nquantity in linking multiple cues. We will also derive specific \r\noptimization procedures for integrating prior knowledge with these \r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nI will first analyze image deblurring problem using two observations. \r\nGiven that the two inputs are taken from the same static scene, the \r\ninvariant quantity is the common clear image. Since the two input images \r\nhave different motion blur defects, their frequency responses are \r\ncomplementary to each other. A feedback algorithm is proposed that \r\neffectively combines two independently blurred images. This approach \r\nintroduces an image prior and a motion prior in the context of multiple \r\nobservations. Consequently, the visual quality of enhancement is greatly \r\nimproved compared to approaches using single images.\r\n\r\n  The second part of this thesis will focus on denoising. Removing noise \r\nfrom images is a topic which has been studied for decades. However, there \r\nare limitations inherent in most previous automatic approaches, which \r\nusually take the image itself as the processing target. We show that even \r\nwith a single input image, an auxiliary observation, namely the noise \r\nlayer can be constructed. Using an extracted noise layer, the artifacts of \r\nautomatic denoising algorithms can be easily visualized and optimization \r\ncan be performed on both image layer and noise layer. We propose an \r\ninteractive system based on this representation, which allows a user to \r\nachieve high quality image noise separation results.\r\n\r\nThe image denoising system will be extended to video to denoise multiple \r\nframes which already exist as observations. The key issue this thesis is \r\nhow to set up connections between these observations. Classical method of \r\nfinding inter-frame correspondences is optical flow estimation which gives \r\npixel-wise motion field. An extended motion field, which is called \r\nprobabilistic motion field will be introduced to characterize soft \r\ntemporal correspondences. The corresponding pixels will be placed inside a \r\nspatio-temporal Markov Random Field where the denoised frames are \r\noptimized using multiple observations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 25 August 2009\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm-4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25-26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. King-Lun Yeung (CBME)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Chi-Keung Tang (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Long Quan\r\n \t\t\tProf. Chiew-Lan Tai\r\n \t\t\tProf. Weichuan Yu (ECE)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Pheng-Ann Heng (Comp.

Geometry level-of-detail \r\napproaches have been introduced to computer graphics to handle complex meshes, \r\nand with the recently rapid evolution of graphics hardware, accelerations of \r\nthese approaches with a commodity GPU has become practical. This thesis reviews \r\nthe some of the important work on geometry level-of-detail, and presents a \r\nscheme for view-dependent geometry level-of-detail control that is implemented \r\nentirely on programmable graphics hardware. Our scheme selectively refines and \r\ncoarsens an arbitrary triangle mesh at the granularity of individual vertices \r\nto create meshes that are highly adapted to dynamic view parameters. Such \r\nfine-grain control has previously been demonstrated using sequential CPU \r\nalgorithms. However, these algorithms involve pointer-based structures with \r\nintricate dependencies that cannot be handled efficiently within the restricted \r\nframework of GPU parallelism. We show that by introducing new data structures \r\nand dependency rules, one can realize fine-grain progressive mesh updates as a \r\nsequence of parallel streaming passes over the mesh elements. A major design \r\nchallenge is that the GPU processes stream elements in isolation. The mesh \r\nupdate algorithm has time complexity proportional to the selectively refined \r\nmesh, and moreover can be amortized across several frames. The result is a \r\nsingle standard index buffer than can be used directly for rendering. The \r\nstatic data structure is remarkably compact, requiring only 57% more memory \r\nthan an indexed triangle list.

Relatively speaking, there has been not much work\r\non providing VoD service using P2P approaches. Providing P2P on-demand\r\nstreaming is challenging due to unreliability of end-hosts and\r\ndifficulty in locating supplying peers, which we address in this\r\nproposal. In this proposal, two critical issues in P2P VoD systems are\r\nstudied and addressed. The first issue is to locate supplying peers who\r\npossess the requested media data in a large P2P network. This is\r\nimportant for supporting VoD user interactivity functionalities such as\r\nrandom forward/backward seek. After supplying peers are located, the\r\nsecond issue is to effectively and efficiently distribute data among\r\npeers. In this context, scalable error recovery techniques are required\r\nto provide resilient service.\r\n\r\nWe first propose a scalable P2P VoD system named PRIME, which is based\r\non sliding window buffering at client sides. We introduce the concept of\r\nvirtual arrival slot and apply distributed hash table (DHT) for locating\r\nqualified parents during startup and random seeking. Preliminary results\r\nshow that PRIME achieves low startup and seeking delay. However, like\r\nother sliding window buffering approaches, missing packets due to packet\r\nloss and node failure are accumulated along data paths. Therefore, we\r\npresent a novel error recovery scheme called LER to enhance the error\r\nresilience of media streaming systems. In LER, peers are assigned to\r\ndifferent planes, on each of which peers form a streaming overlay.\r\nPacket loss is recovered from peers on other planes rather than those on\r\nthe same plane. This scheme is expected to be better than traditional\r\nparent recovery because the errors experienced by a peer and its parents\r\nare highly correlated. In PRIME, there are more suppliers for more\r\npopular video segments, thus it is intrinsically popularity-aware.\r\nHowever, its cache-and-relay approach makes its peers suffer from buffer\r\nshortage during parent interactivity like random seeking. This is\r\nbecause the parent may start caching media data which is no longer\r\ninterested by the child peer. Hence, we introduce another system called\r\nVMesh, in which peers statically store video segments at local storage\r\nand serve others using the stored segments. We will show that\r\nVMesh would achieve a good performance under lossy network condition and\r\nrandom user interactivity. Since segment popularities (or access\r\nprobabilities) are usually non-uniform, we will study a popularity-aware\r\nsegment distribution protocol to allocate segments dynamically according\r\nto their popularities.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tTuesday, 6 November 2007\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:30a.m.-12:30p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3402\r\n\t\t\tlifts 17-18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Gary Chan (Supervisor)\r\n                        Prof. Mounir Hamdi (Chairperson)\r\n\t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala\r\n\t\t\tDr. Oscar Au (ECE)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Offering Interactivity and Reliability for Peer-to-Peer Video-on-Demand"], "lenArticle": 454},

To facilitate a user to retrieve\r\nrelevant records from different web databases simultaneously, we propose a\r\nsimultaneous querying system, called SIM-querying, which is comprised of\r\nthree components: query interface integrator, data extractor and result\r\nintegrator. In each component, a novel method is presented that performs\r\nits function automatically. In the query interface integrator, a holistic\r\nschema matching method, HSM, is presented that takes advantage of the\r\nattribute occurrence patterns in multiple query interfaces to find the\r\nattributes that match in different interfaces within a domain. In the data\r\nextractor, a domain-based method, ODE, is presented. In ODE, a domain\r\nontology is first learned from the information overlap and schema matching\r\nin the query results and query interfaces from different web databases\r\nwithin the domain and the ontology is then used to extract the data\r\nencoded in the result HTML pages automatically. In the result integrator,\r\na new duplicate detection method, UDD, is presented to identify the\r\nduplicates that exist in the query results from different web databases.\r\nIn UDD, a set of negative records is first constructed based on two\r\nobservations about the query results of web databases and then, starting\r\nfrom the negative records, an iterative algorithm identifies the\r\nduplicates from different web databases.

In\r\nthis paradigm, web services from different organizations could be composed\r\nto realize business goals.  To safeguard application consistency in such\r\nan environment, atomicity is a desirable property in a service\r\ncomposition, in the sense that the service composition could either\r\nterminate successfully or abort without any side effects. However,\r\nconventional transactional approaches are inapplicable in such environment\r\ndue to the longrunning, distributed, autonomous and heterogeneous nature\r\nof web services. Instead, weak consistency approaches, such as exception\r\nhandling, are often adopted to resolve application inconsistency based on\r\nthe concept of atomicity sphere.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, we propose a process algebraic framework to study the\r\natomicity property in a service composition using the exception handling\r\napproach.  We discuss the following three research issues:\r\n\r\n1) The global analysis of atomicity sphere in a service composition. In\r\nservice composition, service providers usually provide abstract public\r\nviews of their services to service consumers. These public views expose\r\nonly partial information of their services. Therefore, it is difficult to\r\nanalyze the atomicity sphere of a service composition using existing work\r\nbecause they need full comprehensive information about the provided\r\nservices. To address this issue, we propose an approach to publishing the\r\natomicity information of services in their public views. Service consumers\r\ncould then use these public views to check the atomicity sphere in a\r\nservice composition instead of using the services.\r\n\r\n2) The local analysis of atomicity sphere in a service composition. In\r\nsome situations, besides the details of their services, organizations may\r\nalso be not willing to share the information about its collaborators with\r\nother collaborators in a service composition due to privacy concerns or\r\nbusiness reasons. To check the atomicity sphere of a service composition\r\nin such scenarios, the global analysis approach is incompetent. To address\r\nthis issue, we propose an alternative way to check the atomicity sphere of\r\na service composition using a local analysis approach.\r\n\r\n3) The detection and resolution of atomicity violations in a service\r\ncomposition. Concurrent execution of services may lead to implicit\r\ninteractions between services (i.e., resource sharing). Such implicit\r\ninteractions may also cause an atomicity violation at runtime even if a\r\nservice composition satisfies the atomicity sphere. To address this issue,\r\nwe propose an approach to identify only afflicted implicit interactions in\r\na service composition, and suppress their threats to atomicity with extra\r\nbehavior constraints.\r\n\r\nWe evaluate the framework of our proposal based on examples modeled after\r\na couple of real life applications, and the associated experimental\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:  \t\t\tThursday, 22 November 2007\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:00a.m.-12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:  \t\tRoom 3301A\r\n\t\t\tlifts 17-18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Shing-Chi Cheung (Supervisor)\r\n                        Dr. Jogesh Muppala (Chairperson)\r\n\t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n\t\t\tDr. Zonghua Gu\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Atomicity Analysis for Service Composition"], "lenArticle": 477},

Among all the\r\nenergy-saving schemes, topology control has been well recognized as an\r\nefficient one. By providing an appropriate support for routing protocols,\r\ntopology control enables more energy-efficient transmissions.\r\n\r\nTraditional topology control algorithms are based on the deterministic\r\nmodel that assumes a pair of nodes is either connected or disconnected. In\r\npractice, however, most wireless links are intermittently connected,\r\ncalled lossy links. By successfully leveraging these lossy links, more\r\nenergy-efficient topologies are available. To seize the opportunity of\r\nlossy links, in this proposal I propose a new topology control scheme\r\ncalled probabilistic topology control. The key concept in probabilistic\r\ntopology control is to quantify what percentage of nodes is expected to\r\nconnect to the network, in the presence of lossy links, called network\r\nreachability. I prove that the probabilistic topology control is NP-hard.\r\nTo serve different communication paradigms and address the problem in\r\ndistributed environments, I propose two topology control algorithms called\r\nCONREAP and BRASP. The former CONREAP is for sink-to-sensor communications\r\nand BRASP is for general sensor-to-sensor communications. I prove that\r\nCONREAP has guaranteed network reachability for the derived topology. The\r\nworst running time is (|E|) and the space requirement is O(d). Preliminary\r\nexperimental results show that CONREAP can remarkably reduce the energy\r\ncost. It is more appropriate for low requirement and large transitional\r\nregion environments.\r\n\r\nMy future work will be carried out along following directions. First, I\r\nwill conduct more experiments and simulations to comprehensively evaluate\r\nthe performance of CONREAP in different settings and environments. Second,\r\nI will continue to design and implement BRASP for general communication\r\nparadigms. Third, I plan to compare CONREAP and BRASP in a single setting\r\nto get an integrated understanding of the advantages and weakness.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tTuesday, 4 December 2007\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00p.m.-4:00p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3304\r\n\t\t\tlifts 17-18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Lionel Ni (Supervisor)\r\n                        Dr. Gary Chan (Chairperson)\r\n\t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n\t\t\tDr. Qian Zhang\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["PROBABILISTIC TOPOLOGY CONTROL IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS"], "lenArticle": 349},

By classifying sensor network\r\napplications into two categories - periodical monitoring applications and\r\nevent detection applications, I propose two general clustering\r\nframeworks, K-hop clustering and dynamic clustering correspondingly.\r\n\r\nI tackle three critical problems.

The objective function of the\r\noptimization problem under this regularization framework is comprised of\r\ntwo parts, i.e., the loss and the regularizer. Besides the parameters we\r\naim to optimize, there are some other hyperparameters in the formulation,\r\ne.g., the regularization parameter and the kernel hyperparameter, whose\r\nvalues have to be specified in advance by the user. The optimal\r\nhyperparameter value is data dependent, and prior knowledge is often\r\nrequired to set its value properly. The traditional approach to this model\r\nselection problem is to apply methods like cross validation to determine\r\nthe best choice among a number of prespecified hyperparameter values.\r\nExtensive exploration, such as performing line search for one\r\nhyperparameter or grid search for two hyperparameters, is usually used.\r\nHowever, this requires training the model multiple times with different\r\nhyperparameter values and hence is computationally prohibitive especially\r\nwhen the number of candidate values is very large.\r\n\r\nSolution path algorithms provide a new approach to the model selection\r\nproblem. Such algorithms attempt to calculate every solution for each\r\npossible hyperparameter value without having to re-train the model\r\nmultiple times. Since it can rapidly generate the full path of solutions,\r\nthe optimal value can be found with a low extra computational cost through\r\nestimating the generalization errors under different hyperparameter\r\nvalues. For a large family of statistical learning models, the path of\r\nsolutions extends in a piecewise linear manner. Hence, it is efficient to\r\nexplore the entire solution path by monitoring the breakpoints only.\r\nHowever, in some problems, the solution paths are nonlinear with respect\r\nto a hyperparameter and it is challenging to have an efficient approach to\r\ntrace the nonlinear solution path.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we investigate this new class of algorithms. We provide a\r\ngeneral method investigating how to analyze the solution space of learning\r\nmodels and how to derive their path-following algorithms. Based on this\r\nmethod, we develop solution path algorithms for many learning models.\r\nThese algorithms have shown many advantages over previous problem-solving\r\napproaches.

{"date": "2007-12-28", "description": "\nPhD Thesis Proposal Defence\r\n\r\n\r\nTitle: \"Intelligent Sampling over Wireless Sensor Networks\"\r\n\r\nby\r\n\r\nMiss Yongzhen Zhuang\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nNowadays, wireless sensor networks are being widely used in many\r\nmonitoring applications, such as monitoring farm belts, large-scale\r\nhabitats, environmental disasters, and so on and so forth. The tiny\r\ndistributed sensors provide samples of environmental parameters, for\r\nexample, temperature, humidity, gas pressure, decibel levels, to the\r\napplications. Since sensors are always constrained by their limited\r\nbattery power, how to efficiently use a large number of sensors and\r\ntheir samples according to the application needs is of great importance.\r\nMore specifically, we discuss two types of sampling techniques, temporal\r\nand spatial.\r\n\r\nTemporal sampling decides how many samples a sensor should obtain to,\r\nfor example, process a query, clean the data, or detect an event. In\r\nother words, temporal sampling adjusts the sampling rates to achieve\r\nenough accuracy in the application. It is known that tiny imprecise\r\nsensors are of low data quality and are easily affected by random noise.\r\nThey cannot provide bounded accuracy for the applications built upon\r\nthem. One way to increase the accuracy is by multiple sampling, which is\r\nthe most effective and straightforward technique to improve the data\r\nquality. The basic idea is to obtain multiple samples from either one or\r\nseveral sensors, and use their average in the applications. The\r\nenforcement of this multiple sampling technique in sensor network\r\napplications is not trivial, for the sensed data are distributed\r\ntime series and sensors have to collaborate to achieve the overall\r\naccuracy requirement of the application. Our goal is to use an\r\nappropriate number of samples in each sensor depending on the\r\napplication requirements. We mainly focus on three applications, query\r\nprocessing, data cleaning and event detection. In the query application,\r\nwe build a query plan to minimize the sampling cost while satisfying the\r\naccuracy constraint. In the data cleaning application, we use weighted\r\nmoving average with weights came from a sampling process to efficiently\r\nreconstruct the true data with low sampling costs. In the event\r\ndetection application, we use range prediction and a hypothesis test to\r\nlocate events in realtime with high confidence.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, spatial sampling focuses on selecting a subset of\r\nsensors to be used in a monitoring application. In many applications,\r\nspatial sampling can dramatically reduce the energy consumption because\r\nthe sensors that are not selected can switch themselves to a low-cost\r\nsleep mode. Spatial sampling can have many alternatives, depending on the\r\napplication requirements. For example, clustering-based sampling, such as\r\nsnapshot sampling, uses a representative sensor to substitute for the\r\nsimilar sensors nearby. Our ongoing works of spatial sampling mainly focus\r\non the following directions: (1) We model the event detection application\r\nas regional pattern queries, and propose a spatial sampling approach based\r\non random walk to find the pattern regions. We show that it is more\r\nefficient to walk through a random path to locate the pattern region than\r\nabundantly revoke many irrelevant sensors, especially when the monitoring\r\nfield is huge and the pattern regions are rare. (2) In many applications,\r\nthe placement of the sensors can be quite irregular due to the\r\nconstruction of the monitoring area (steep rocky, moderate incline, or\r\nflat silty) and sorts of natural effects (flood or wind). We propose an\r\nunbiased sampling technique that selects and weights sensors so that to\r\nprovide an unbiased representation to the application as if the sensors\r\nare deployed uniformly. (3) We present a section sampling technique that\r\ngroups sensors into random sections. Each single section can represent the\r\nmonitoring field by its own. We can achieve more energy efficiency by\r\nusing fewer sections, or high query accuracy by using more sections. (4)\r\nWe propose a new model for the event detection application that defines\r\nevents as the top-k regions with the highest regional statistics (e.g.\r\nregional sum). We try to adopt the sampling techniques to provide an\r\naccurate and energy efficient approximation of the top-k regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tThursday, 10 January 2008\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:00a.m.-12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n\t\t\tlifts 25-26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Lei Chen (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\tProf. Frederick Lochovsky (Chairperson)\r\n                        Dr. Shing-Chi Cheung\r\n\t\t\tProf. Vincent Shen\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Intelligent Sampling over Wireless Sensor Networks"], "lenArticle": 688},

These nodes are autonomous\r\ndevices with integrated sensing, processing, and communication\r\ncapabilities. In general, wireless sensor networks intend to provide\r\ninformation on spatio-temporal characteristics of the observed physical\r\nworld. Hence, it is necessary to associate sensed data with locations,\r\nmaking data geographically meaningful. A number of applications, such as\r\nobject tracking, environment monitoring, inherently rely on location\r\ninformation. Besides, location information also supports fundamental\r\nnetwork layer services, such as topology control, routing, clustering, and\r\nso on. Hence, Localization, a mechanism for autonomously discovering and\r\nestablishing spatial relationships among sensor nodes, is of great\r\nimportance in the development of wireless sensor networks.\r\n\r\nThis survey reviews diverse physical measuring abilities of sensor nodes,\r\ndiscusses issues in localization algorithm design, presents the\r\nstate-of-the-art localization techniques, and finally suggests future\r\ndirections in localization studies. Many localization approaches are\r\nproposed based on diverse positioning principles, environmental\r\nconstrains, accuracy requirements, etc., making them suitable/unsuitable\r\nfor different applications. This survey in depth elaborates and compares\r\nexisting approaches from two aspects: physical measurement and\r\nnetwork-wide localization. The design tradeoffs of localization\r\nalgorithms, as well as their advantages and disadvantages, are emphasized\r\nfor comparison. Among these localization techniques, no specific algorithm\r\nis a clear favorite across the spectrum.  In conclusion, localization is a\r\nnew and exciting field, with new algorithms, hardware, and applications\r\nbeing developed at a feverish pace.

If the English word \"drug\"\r\ntranslates into French as either \"drogue\" (used as a narcotic) or\r\n\"medicament\" (used as a medicine), then an English-French machine\r\ntranslation system needs to disambiguate every use of \"drug\" in order to\r\nmake the correct translations.\r\n\r\nHeavy effort has been put in designing and evaluating dedicated WSD\r\nmodels, in particular with the Senseval series of workshops. This is\r\npartly motivated by the often unstated assumption that any full\r\ntranslation system, to achieve full performance, will sooner or later have\r\nto incorporate individual WSD components. However, in most machine\r\ntranslation architectures, in particular SMT, the WSD problem is typically\r\nnot explicitly addressed. This paradoxical situation encouraged\r\nspeculation that recent progress in SMT shows that SMT models are already\r\nvery good at WSD and that current WSD systems have nothing to offer to\r\nstate-of-the-art SMT.\r\n\r\nGoing beyond these untested assumptions and speculative claims, we conduct\r\nthe first direct extensive empirical study of the strengths and weaknesses\r\nof WSD and SMT. Using the state-of-the-art HKUST WSD system, we\r\nsurprisingly show that incorporating WSD predictions in SMT does not help\r\ntranslation quality. Puzzlingly, we also report results suggesting that\r\ntypical SMT models cannot disambiguate word translations as well as\r\ndedicated WSD systems.\r\n\r\nThese seemingly contradictory results lead us to generalize conventional\r\nWSD models to incorporate assumptions at least as strong as in\r\nstate-of-the-art SMT. Specifically, (1) WSD targets are generalized from\r\nwords to phrases, (2) WSD sense inventories and annotation are learned\r\nautomatically in the same way as conventional SMT translation lexicons,\r\nand (3) WSD models are fully integrated in SMT decoding.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, the resulting generalized phrasal WSD-for-SMT models improve\r\ntranslation quality across four different Chinese-to-English translation\r\ntasks, as measured by eight common automatic evaluation metrics. Further\r\nanalysis reveals that generalization from conventional WSD to generalized\r\nphrasal WSD-for-SMT is necessary in order to obtain consistent\r\nimprovements in translation quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 14 January 2008\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00p.m.-4:00p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3301\r\n\t\t\tLifts 17-18\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Andrew Miller (BIOL)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dekai Wu (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\tProf. Brian Mak\r\n\t\t\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung\r\n\t\t\tProf. Pascale Fung (ECE)\r\n\t\t\tProf. Bertram Shi (ECE)\r\n\t\t\tProf. Dragomir Radev (EECS, Univ. of Michigan)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Word Sense Disambiguation for Statistical Machine Translation"], "lenArticle": 439},

One way to incorporate multiple information sources under\r\nthe HMM framework is to use the multi-stream HMM. The state log likelihood\r\nof a multi-stream HMM is usually computed as a linear combination of the\r\nstream log-likelihoods using a set of stream weights. The estimation of\r\nstream weights is important because it can affect the performance of the\r\nmulti-stream HMM greatly. Various estimation methods have been proposed.\r\nSome pose the estimation of stream weights as an optimization problem and\r\nvarious objective functions such as minimum classification error and\r\nmaximum entropy had been tried. In this thesis, we cast the estimation of\r\nstream weights into a linear programming (LP) problem. The LP formulation\r\nis very flexible, allowing various degrees of tying the stream weights. It\r\nalso de-couples the estimation of stream weights from the recognition\r\nsystem so that the estimation may be done by any commonly available and\r\nefficient LP solvers. In practice, however, we may not have complete\r\nknowledge of the feasible region since it is constructed from a limited\r\nnumber of competing hypotheses generated from the current acoustic model.\r\nWe investigate an iterative LP optimization algorithm in which additional\r\nconstraints on the parameters being optimized is further imposed. We\r\nevaluate our LP formulation in automatic speech recognition using the\r\nResource Management recognition task. It is found that the stream weights\r\nof a 4-stream HMM found via our LP formulation reduce the word error rate\r\n(WER) of the baseline system by 17% and WER of the stream weights found by\r\nextensive brute-force grid search by 8.75%.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 15 January 2008\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:00a.m.-12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3402\r\n\t\t\tLifts 17-18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Brian Mak (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\tDr. Dit-Yan Yeung (Chairperson)\r\n\t\t\tDr. Huamin Qu\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Discriminative Training of Stream Weights in a Multi-Stream HMM as a Linear Programming Problem"], "lenArticle": 321},

At first, cognitive\r\nradio networks inherit security problems from general wireless networks,\r\nsuch as jamming, misbehaviors in routing discovery and data forwarding,\r\netc. Secondly, cognitive radio networks have some new security problems\r\nbecause of their special architecture, for example, misbehaviors in\r\nspectrum sensing and analysis, attacks aiming on interference to licensed\r\nusers, emulation of licensed users and so on. In this survey, we at first\r\nintroduce the building blocks of security in cognitive radio networks,\r\nthen propose possible security problems and summarize existing solutions\r\naddressing on them.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tTuesday, 29 January 2008\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00p.m.-4:00p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n\t\t\tlifts 25-26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Qian Zhang (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\tProf. Mounir Hamdi (Chairperson)\r\n\t\t\tDr. Bo Li\r\n\t\t\tProf. Lionel Ni\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["A Survey on Security Issues in Wireless Cognitive Radio Networks"], "lenArticle": 196},

After\r\ncollecting traces of different runs of the target programs with various\r\ninputs, we can perform the analysis on the reference variables with the\r\nsame type, which are equivalent to pointers. Being different from the\r\nprevious research, this research is a hybrid of static and dynamic\r\nanalysis. We obtain the execution trace by running the program, and then\r\nwe statically analyze the trace to discover the pointer alias information.\r\n\r\nA trace tracks the complete information of one-time-run of the target\r\nprogram with certain input. With different inputs, we can get different\r\ntraces of the program demonstrating the behavior of the program. After\r\nanalyzing a particular trace, we are sure to discover the portion of the\r\npointer alias pairs related to that run. And the result is obviously\r\nsound. We can approximate the complete result by analyzing the traces with\r\ndifferent inputs and check the set of alias pair for convergence. Being\r\nsimilar to other dynamic analysis algorithm, the choice and coverage of\r\nthe inputs are important to the result we discover.\r\n\r\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first to analyze the pointer\r\nalias information in Java programs by execution traces on the source code\r\nlevel. The contribution of our work is that the algorithm we propose is\r\nprecise compared the flow-insensitive algorithms of Steensgaard's and\r\nAndersen's, while the time complexity is moderate.

In this proposal, we study rate adaptation and\r\nresource allocation methodologies for 802.11 WLANs. Rate adaptation is a\r\nkey functionality in WLAN devices to cope with time-varying channel\r\nconditions and maximize the throughput of a point-to-point wireless link.\r\nWe propose a novel rate adaptation algorithm, \"Smart Sender\", which\r\nutilizes both statistics and signal strength measurements to select the\r\ntransmission rate that maximizes the link throughput. We also implement\r\nand evaluate the algorithm in commercial WLAN devices, which prove that\r\nSmart Sender is fast-responsive, of low-overhead, and robust to collision\r\nerrors in various wireless environments.\r\n\r\nWhile rate adaptation exploits the multi-rate capability of an individual\r\nuser, it also results in the well-known phenomenon of \"performance\r\nanomaly\" among multiple rate-different users sharing the WLAN. Hence,\r\nefficient resource allocation among these users is critical to the system\r\nperformance. For downlink resource allocation, we develop a weighted fair\r\nscheduling based on adaptive rate control (WFS-ARC) framework for\r\nthroughput optimization while satisfying the temporal fairness. For\r\nresource allocation with TCP flows in a WLAN, we design a dual queue\r\nmanagement (DQM) scheme for TCP congestion avoidance and uplink/downlink\r\nfairness provisioning. DQM also exploits opportunistic scheduling for high\r\nlink efficiency.\r\n\r\nFor future work, we will study rate adaptation and resource allocation\r\nmethodologies for IEEE 802.11n WLANs and Vehicular Ad hoc Networks\r\n(VANET).

The fundamental function of wireless sensor networks is the\r\ncollection of information from an area of interest by sensor nodes, and\r\nthe processing of such information by sink nodes according to some\r\nparticular application. Delivering the gathered information from sensor\r\nnodes to sink nodes effectively is one of the fundamental challenges in\r\nwireless sensor networks. To achieve flexibility in deployment, sensor\r\nnodes are generally battery-driven. Furthermore, battery replacement is\r\nnot likely, if possible at all; thus, sensor nodes, and as a consequence\r\nthe sensor network, have a limited operational time. Hence, energy\r\nefficiency is a key issue in the design, deployment and operation of\r\nwireless sensor networks. To improve the performance of wireless sensor\r\nnetworks, data delivery in sensor networks should be both energy efficient\r\nand effective, which is the focus of this thesis proposal.\r\n\r\nFirst, we observe the conflicts of objectives -- viz., the application\r\nperformance and the network lifetime -- when optimizing the performance of\r\nwireless sensor networks. We find that the tradeoff between these\r\nobjectives can be studied by investigating the interaction between the\r\nnetwork lifetime maximization problem and the rate allocation problem.\r\nThen, we formulate the tradeoff problem as a constrained convex\r\noptimization problem by introducing a tradeoff factor and first tackle\r\nthis problem at the transport layer, and then from a cross layer\r\nperspective. Using Lagrange dual decomposition, algorithms are obtained to\r\nachieve the best tradeoff. Second, we note that the notion of reliability\r\nin certain wireless sensor networks is probabilistic. Based on this, the\r\nproblem of providing minimum energy probabilistic reliable data delivery\r\nis studied. It is tackled at the MAC layer, using p-persistent protocols.\r\nAdaptive algorithms are derived to tune the persistence probability of\r\nthese protocols based on Lagrange dual decomposition method.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tFriday, 1 February 2008\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:30a.m.-12:30p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 4480\r\n\t\t\tlifts 25-26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Brahim Bensaou (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala (Chairperson)\r\n                        Dr. Gary Chan\r\n\t\t\tProf. Mounir Hamdi\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Energy Efficient Reliable Data Delivery in Wireless Sensor Networks"], "lenArticle": 362},

Verification of SystemC models is traditionally\r\nbased on time-consuming simulation. There are two main challenges to\r\neffective verification of SystemC models. First, SystemC is inherently\r\nconcurrent, and interleaving among the parallel threads can cause state\r\nspace explosion in model-checking. Second, real-time can be explicitly\r\nmodeled in SystemC, and the verification of time-related property brings\r\nnew challenges, especially when combined with concurrency. There are many\r\ndifferences as well as similarities between verification of concurrent\r\nmultithreaded software, i.e., Java, and verification of SystemC models.\r\nFormal methods, such as model checking, SAT (Satisfiability Solving), SMT\r\n(Satisfiability Modulo Theories), QBF (Quantified Boolean Formula), ILP\r\n(Integer Linear Programming), have been widely used in both software and\r\nhardware verification, and there have been some attempts at applying them\r\nto verify SystemC models. In this report, I present a survey on recent\r\nwork on formal verification techniques for SystemC as well as concurrent\r\nsoftware.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tWednesday, 16 April 2008\r\n\r\nTime:                   3:30p.m.-5:30p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3402\r\n\t\t\tlifts 17-18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Zonghua Gu (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\tDr. Shing-Chi Cheung (Chairperson)\r\n\t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala\r\n\t\t\tProf. Vincent Shen\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Formal Verification Techniques for SystemC"], "lenArticle": 226},

These\r\napplications commonly also include relational tables, e.g., to store user\r\nprofiles. In this paper, we propose keyword search over relational data\r\nstreams (S-KWS) as an effective way to query such heterogeneous\r\nenvironments, consisting of both, tables and streams. Compared to\r\nstructured query methods, S-KWS has several benefits. First, it allows\r\nsearching for combinations of terms without knowing in which data sources\r\nthey appear. Second, it hides the schema from users and allows it to\r\nchange over time, without requiring queries to be re-written.  Third,\r\nkeyword queries are easy to express. Finally, many query tasks only become\r\nfeasible through S-KWS. Our contributions are summarized as follows. (i)\r\nWe provide formal semantics, addressing the temporal validity and order of\r\nresults, spanning uniformly over tables and streams. (ii) We introduce two\r\ngeneral methodologies for query processing: graph based (GB) and operator\r\nbased (OB). The first generates results by traversing a data graph; the\r\nsecond by executing operator trees. (iii) We present a range of\r\noptimizations for both approaches. For GB, we speed up graph traversals,\r\nusing keyword labels.  For OB, we integrate operator trees into a single\r\nmesh, sharing common expressions. Join operations are further reduced,\r\nusing demand driven operator execution. The operator mesh dynamically\r\nadapts to changes in the schema and input characteristics. Two strategies\r\nfor purging outdated tuples target either CPU or memory. Extensive\r\nexperiments demonstrate the practicability of S-KWS as well as the\r\ntremendous benefits of the proposed optimizations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tThursday, 17 April 2008\r\n\r\nTime:                   3:30p.m.-5:30p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3405\r\n\t\t\tlifts 17-18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Dimitris Papadias (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\tProf. Mounir Hamdi (Chairperson)\r\n                        Dr. Lei Chen\r\n\t\t\tProf. Nikos Mamoulis (HKU)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Keyword Search over Relational Data"], "lenArticle": 305},

A user profile capturing a user's personal preferences\r\ncan help to disambiguate the actual intent of a query.

Both facts impose a challenge on the router's\r\nscalability with regard to this increasing number of network flows\r\nand switching ports. In addition, routers are also required to be\r\nable to provide Quality-of-Service (QoS) at the surge of\r\ntriple-play services (data, voice and video) in\r\nNext-Generation-Networks (NGN) . In this proposal, we try to\r\naddress the connection ports scalability issue and design the\r\nrouters with QoS support as well.\r\n\r\nThe two main router components we are investigating are: the\r\nswitch fabric and the memory subsystem. We start from the\r\nSpace-Memory-Space switch design paradigm that is proven to\r\nprovide QoS relatively easily, and use the Clos-interconnection to\r\nscale its space parts. By making all buffers fully shared (in a\r\ndistributed way), we show that the Central-stage Buffered\r\nClos-network (CBC we propose) are scalable in terms of not only\r\nthe hardware cost, but the efficient scheduling algorithms as\r\nwell. To scale the router's memory subsystem, we employ\r\nparallelism into current SRAM/DRAM combination solutions and\r\ndesign a Parallel Hybrid SRAM/DRAM (PHSD) memory system. By a very\r\nsimple yet efficient memory management algorithm, we show that the\r\nPHSD can significantly outperform previous solutions by\r\nreducing both the packet delay and the costly SRAM requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tMonday, 5 May 2008\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:30a.m.-12:30p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3301\r\n\t\t\tlifts 17-18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Mounir Hamdi (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\tDr. Qian Zhang (Chairperson)\r\n                        Dr. Yunhao Liu\r\n\t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Building Scalable Next Generation Internet Routers"], "lenArticle": 317},

In this\r\nthesis, we present a method which does not based on integrability\r\nenforcement, and reconstructs a 3D continuous surface from a gradient\r\nfield which can be dense or sparse. The key of our approach is the use of\r\nkernel basis functions, which transfers the continuous surface\r\nreconstruction problem into high dimensional space where a closed-form\r\nsolution exists.

Due to\r\nthe increasing complexity of meshes, it is usually hard to manipulate them\r\nwithout simplifications. Geometry level of detail (LOD) has been studied\r\nextensively which mainly consists of simplification methods and\r\nsimplification representations of triangle meshes. The mesh\r\nsimplifications methods reduce the complexity of an original mesh by\r\nsimplifying unimportant portions of the mesh without sacrificing the\r\nquality of the mesh.

Most machine learning algorithms have a common assumption that\r\nthe distributions between training data and test data are the same.\r\nHowever, in many real world applications, the training data may be\r\nout-of-date due to dynamic environmental factors.  In addition, we might\r\nwant to use the training data in one task domain to learn prediction\r\nmodels for use in another domain. In these cases, the distributions\r\nbetween the training data and the test data may be very different.

In this thesis, we study rate adaptation and resource\r\nallocation methodologies for 802.11-based wireless networks. Rate\r\nadaptation is a key functionality of 802.11 devices allowing them to cope\r\nwith time-varying channel conditions and to maximize the throughput of\r\npoint-to-point wireless links. We propose a novel rate adaptation\r\nalgorithm, \"Smart Sender\" for 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs),\r\nwhich utilizes both statistics and signal strength measurements to select\r\nthe transmission rate that maximizes the link throughput. We also\r\nimplement and evaluate the algorithm in commercial WLAN devices, which\r\nproves that Smart Sender responsive, has low overheads, and is robust to\r\ncollision errors in various wireless environments.\r\n\r\nWe further study rate adaptation for Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs)\r\nwith an 802.11 physical layer. Different from traditional methods\r\nemploying periodic channel quality estimations, we propose to use a\r\nlearning algorithm MTRA (Model Tree based Rate Adaptation) which trains a\r\npacket error rate model for different data rates. In real time, MTRA takes\r\nmultiple inputs from the environment and outputs a rate decision\r\nsatisfying specific packet error rate requirements. This approach can\r\neffectively utilize the available environmental information (distance,\r\nSNR, speed, and so on) for timely rate adaptation, hence avoiding the\r\nestimation delay experienced by the legacy methods. By locating the\r\noptimal rate for current channel conditions as soon as possible, MTRA\r\noffers superior throughput performance compared to other popular methods.\r\n\r\nWhile rate adaptation exploits the multi-rate capability of an individual\r\nuser, it also results in the well-known phenomenon of \"performance\r\nanomaly\" among multiple rate-different users sharing the WLAN. Therefore,\r\nefficient resource allocation among multiple users is critical to the\r\nsystem performance. For downlink resource allocation, we develop a\r\nweighted fair scheduling based on adaptive rate control (WFS-ARC)\r\nframework for throughput optimization while satisfying temporal fairness.\r\nFor resource allocation with TCP flows in a WLAN, we design a dual queue\r\nmanagement (DQM) scheme for TCP congestion avoidance and uplink/downlink\r\nfairness provisioning. DQM also exploits opportunistic scheduling for high\r\nlink efficiency.\r\n\r\nFor future work, we will study resource allocation methodologies for\r\nwireless networks such as IEEE 802.11n WLANs and IEEE 802.16 mesh\r\nnetworks. We believe the approaches discussed in this thesis could\r\ncontribute to future research on these next generation wireless networks,\r\nby providing a versatile and flexible structure for various systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 3 July 2008\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:00a.m.-12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n\t\t\tLifts 25-26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Philip Mok (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Mounir Hamdi (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\tProf. Brahim Bensaou\r\n\t\t\tProf. Qian Zhang\r\n\t\t\tProf. Ross Murch (ECE)\r\n\t\t\tProf. Hussein Mouftah (Inf.

It is used to model concepts in every\r\narea from science to industry and from theory to everyday life. In recent\r\nyears, we have observed a rapid increase in the volume of graph data,\r\nespecially in the scientific domains and various social networks. However,\r\nthe performance of query processing on large graph databases is still\r\ninadequate.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we develop efficient methods for processing queries on\r\nlarge graph databases. Our work mainly focuses on two types of most\r\npopular graph databases: transaction graph databases that consist of a\r\nlarge set of small graphs (e.g., chemistry and bio-informatics databases)\r\nand large graphs (e.g., the Web and social networks). We develop a novel\r\nindex that supports efficient query processing on large transaction graph\r\ndatabases. We apply the concept of frequent subgraphs and develop a\r\nclustering technique to build the index, which is shown to be orders of\r\nmagnitude more efficient than other existing graph indexes. We also devise\r\nan efficient update strategy for the index. On querying large graphs, we\r\npropose a novel partition-and-conquer paradigm that first partitions a\r\nlarge graph into a set of small communities and then processes a query by\r\nthe integration of intra-community information flow and inter-community\r\nhierarchical relation. This method is particularly useful and practical\r\nsince an algorithm of complexity O(n^2) already does not scale on such\r\nlarge graphs.

Cache-oblivious\r\ntechniques, proposed by the theory community, have optimal asymptotic\r\nbounds on the amount of data transferred between any two adjacent levels\r\nof an arbitrary memory hierarchy. Moreover, this optimal performance is\r\nachieved without any hardware platform specific tuning.

All query\r\nprocessing algorithms in EaseDB are designed to be cache-oblivious and\r\nmatch the performance of their cache-conscious counterparts.

We evaluate EaseDB in comparison with its cache-conscious\r\ncounterparts on different architectures including Intel, AMD and\r\nUltra-Sparc processors. Our results with homegrown workloads and micro\r\nbenchmarks show that our cache-oblivious algorithms achieve a performance\r\ncomparable to their fine-tuned cache-conscious counterparts.

Some examples are wall and grass\r\ntextures in computer-generated graphics and video. In video game sound\r\ndesign, background sounds are very important in creating different mood\r\nand feeling when game players enter different scenes of the video game. In\r\norder to save disk space and memory, sound designers tend to loop a short\r\n(usually 5~15 second) background sound clip to produce a longer (usually\r\nmore than 1 minute) background sound clip. The background sound produced\r\nusing this approach often make the player feel bored. So recent work has\r\napplied the idea of visual texture synthesis to audio texture synthesis,\r\nhoping to synthesis a longer sound clip from a shorter one. However, very\r\nlittle research has successfully synthesized sound textures without\r\nintroducing audible artifacts. This paper describes an enhanced\r\noverlap-add method for sound texture synthesis.  It is especially\r\nwell-suited to sounds with a quasi-oscillatory or random character such as\r\nwaves crashing on the shore and traffic noise. It also works well for\r\nanimal sounds when there are several sources, such as a group of\r\nchattering birds. These are important classes of sounds in computer games,\r\nfilms, and advertisements. The results also suggest that better textures\r\ncan be achieved if acoustic effects are applied.

The root of the problem is that the Internet by nature, i.e.,\r\nautonomous, heterogeneous, best-effort, can not provide the services\r\nrequired by streaming applications. The recent development in Peer-to-Peer\r\n(P2P) technologies brings new momentum in live video streaming due to the\r\ninherent self-scaling property and easy deployment. In spite of its\r\npopularity, there is no consensus on how a large-scale P2P live streaming\r\nsystem works. There are two fundamental problems in the design space:\r\ntopology formulation that relates to how a peer locates the video content\r\nfrom one another and content delivery. Further, there has been little\r\nstudy on the design tradeoffs and large-scale measurements. This thesis\r\nfills this gap.\r\n\r\nWe leverage our earlier system, Coolstreaming, which was arguably the\r\nearliest large-scale P2P video streaming experiment and was widely\r\nreferenced in the community as the benchmark (Google entries top 400,000).\r\nWe design and implemente comprehensive logging tools to collect and\r\nanalyze large sets of traces from real-world broadcasts, from which we\r\nestablish a theoretical framework that (1) concretely demonstrate the\r\nfundamental system design trade-offs and further identify the main\r\nperformance bottlenecks and key factors behind them. Specifically, we show\r\n1) the random topology formulation can lead to convergence and stability;\r\n2) the video streaming performance is critically affected by system\r\ndynamics, in particular churns;  3) the system exhibits excellent scaling\r\nproperty yet the uploading capacity contributions from peers are highly\r\nskewed, in which a small percentage of peers conbtribute most; 4) the\r\nscale and streaming performance is largely determined how well the system\r\ncan handle the flash crowd in live streaming event.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 25 July 2008\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:30p.m.-4:30p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3494\r\n\t\t\tLifts 25-26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Tongyi Zhang (MECH)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Bo Li (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\tProf. Lionel Ni\r\n\t\t\tProf. Qian Zhang\r\n\t\t\tProf. Michael Wong (PHYS)\r\n\t\t\tProf Baochun Li (Elec. & Comp.

In\r\nthis paradigm, web services from different organizations are composed to\r\nrealize business goals. To safeguard application consistency in such an\r\nenvironment, atomicity is a desirable property for a service composition,\r\nin the sense that the service composition could either terminate\r\nsuccessfully or abort without any side effects. However, conventional\r\ndatabase transactions are inapplicable in such an environment due to the\r\nlong-running, distributed, autonomous and heterogeneous nature of web\r\nservices. Instead, exception handling, a weak consistency approach, is\r\noften adopted to resolve application inconsistency based on the concept of\r\natomicity sphere, a structured criterion for the atomicity property of\r\nservice compositions.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we propose a process algebraic framework to study the\r\natomicity property in a service composition using the exception handling\r\napproach. We discuss the following three research issues:\r\n\r\n1) The global analysis of atomicity sphere for a service composition. In a\r\nservice composition, service providers usually provide only abstract\r\npublic views of their services to service consumers. These public views\r\nexpose only partial information of their services. Therefore, it is\r\ndifficult to analyze the atomicity sphere of a service composition using\r\nexisting work because full comprehensive information about the provided\r\nservices is needed. To address this issue, we propose an approach to\r\npublishing the atomicity information of services in their public views.\r\nService consumers could then use these public views to check the atomicity\r\nsphere in a service composition instead of using the services.\r\n\r\n2) The local analysis of atomicity sphere in a service composition. In\r\nsome situations, besides the details of their services, organizations may\r\nalso not be willing to share information about their collaborators with\r\nthe other collaborators in a service composition due to privacy concerns\r\nor business reasons. To check the atomicity sphere of a service\r\ncomposition in such scenarios, the global analysis approach is\r\nincompetent.

This\r\nresults in context inconsistencies, that is, the conflicts among contexts.\r\nContext inconsistencies may set such software into a wrong state or lead\r\nsoftware to wrongly adjust their behaviors. It is desirable to detect and\r\nthen resolve these inconsistencies in time to prevent software from\r\nmisbehaving.\r\n\r\nOne popular approach is to detect inconsistencies when contexts breach\r\ncertain consistency constraints. Existing constraint checking techniques\r\nrecheck the entire expression of each affected constraint upon context\r\nchanges. However, when a changed context affects only a constraint's\r\nsub-expression, rechecking the entire expression introduces delays to\r\ndetecting other inconsistencies. This thesis proposes a formal model and\r\nits supporting algorithms that identify the parts of previous checking\r\nresults that are reusable without missing context inconsistencies\r\nidentifiable via entire rechecking. This enables us to combine the\r\nreusable and rechecked parts to produce the final results efficiently.

However, the effectiveness of existing\r\nresolution strategies is compromised by their formulated assumptions that\r\ndo not fully hold in practice. To different extents, this makes\r\napplications using the resolved contexts less context-aware than the ideal\r\ncase. This thesis proposes the drop-bad and the impact-oriented\r\nstrategies. With the same goal of protecting context-awareness, the two\r\nstrategies are formulated on an intuitive observation and the\r\napplications' situation specifications, respectively.

By providing an appropriate support for\r\nrouting protocols, topology control enables more energy-efficient\r\ntransmissions and higher network capacity.\r\n\r\nIn traditional topology control, a wireless network is represented using\r\ndeterministic model that assumes a pair of nodes is either connected or\r\ndisconnected. In practice, however, most wireless links are intermittently\r\nconnected, called lossy links. %Rich empirical studies have shown that in\r\nmost practical environments lossy links account the dominating majority of\r\nWSNs, while reliable wireless links are only a small portion of due to the\r\nhigh density, hostile environments, and hardware constraints. It implies\r\nthat these reliable links can only provide very limited support for\r\nrouting. By successfully leveraging these lossy links, topologies of more\r\nenergy-efficiency and higher network capacities are available. By\r\ntraditional deterministic network model, however, WSN topologies can\r\nhardly be well characterized. To seize the opportunity of lossy links, I\r\npropose a new probabilistic network model. Using this model we are able to\r\nquantify the quality of the network connectivity. The key problem in\r\nprobabilistic topology control is to seek an appropriate topology of\r\nminimized energy cost, while the quality of network connectivity satisfied\r\ncertain constraints.\r\n\r\nIn this work, I prove that in general, probabilistic topology control is a\r\nNP-hard problem. To serve different communication paradigms, I propose two\r\nalgorithms called CONREAP and BRASP. The former CONREAP is for\r\nsink-to-sensor communications and BRASP is for general sensor-to-sensor\r\ncommunications. I prove that CONREAP has guaranteed network reachability\r\nfor the derived topology. The worst running time is |E| and the space\r\nrequirement is |d|. Experimental results show that CONREAP can remarkably\r\nreduce the energy cost. It is more appropriate for low requirement and\r\nlarge transitional region environments.\r\n\r\nTo show how to efficiently transmit in a probabilistic wireless network\r\nwith lossy links involved in, I proposed a novel reliability-oriented\r\ntransmission protocol called proliferation routing. It leverages\r\nrandomized dispersion and reproductions. The distinctive feature of\r\nproliferation routing is its great flexibility and high energy-efficiency.\r\nNot only can it be applied with any Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol\r\nand routing metric, but also a desired service quality can be effectively\r\nderived by controlling the system parameters. I conduct comprehensive\r\ntheoretical analysis and confirm it implementation and simulation\r\nexperiments. In a specific experiment setup, proliferation routing can\r\nincrease the end-to-end transmission success rate up to 70% compared with\r\nthe well-known hop-based routing and flooding.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 31 July 2008\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00p.m.-4:00p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n\t\t\tLifts 25-26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Hong-Kam Lo (CIVL)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Lionel Ni (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\tProf. Jogesh Muppala\r\n\t\t\tProf. Qian Zhang\r\n\t\t\tProf. Lilong Cai (MECH)\r\n\t\t\tProf. Jiannong Cao (Computing, PolyU)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Probabilistic topology control in wireless sensor networks"], "lenArticle": 506},

Distinguished from\r\ntypical wireless network, wireless sensor networks face problems of\r\nstringent limited energy, poor dynamic links, and super large quantity of\r\nsensor nodes. These unique characteristics have created a large research\r\nfield and inspired enormous innovative ideas.\r\n\r\nMany applications in wireless sensor networks significantly benefit from\r\norganizing nodes into groups, called clusters, because clustering could\r\nprovide a convenient structure for the design of data aggregation, routing\r\nand topology control algorithms. Clustering has been widely studied in\r\ncomputer science literature. Recently, the most popular works on\r\nclustering are in the topic of wireless ad hoc networks, mainly targeting\r\nat generating stable clusters in a complicated environment with mobile\r\nnodes. Most of these schemes focus on nodes' reachability and route\r\nstability, without much concern about critical design restrictions of\r\nwireless sensor networks, such as energy efficiency and energy balance\r\nwhich could help to extend the life time of wireless sensor networks.\r\n\r\nBy classifying sensor network applications into two categories -\r\nperiodical monitoring applications and event detection applications, we\r\npropose two general clustering frameworks: K-hop static clustering and\r\ndynamic clustering correspondingly.\r\n\r\nThis thesis tackles three critical problems. First, it is straightforward\r\nthat the size of clusters should vary according to diverse applications.\r\nIt is essential to provide a general clustering framework which could\r\nprovide tailored cluster size. Second, I observe that unbalanced clusters\r\nwould dramatically decrease the network lifetime. I design an Evenly\r\nDistributed Clustering (EDC) algorithm. Constrained by the maximum cluster\r\nsize K, EDC distributes clusters uniformly and minimizes the number of\r\nclusters. Third, clustering framework is inevitable to introduce some\r\noverhead. Particularly for infrequent event detection applications, the\r\nmaintenance cost is comparably high because of the dynamic behavior of\r\nwireless sensor networks. A dynamic clustering scheme is proposed to\r\ngenerate clusters on demand without maintaining clustering structure in\r\nthe whole network.

While they\r\nare claimed to reduce coupling and increase flexibility, they are also\r\ncriticized to increase the complexity of software structure. With such\r\nco-existing competing forces, is pre-deploying design patterns useful to\r\nguide maintainers to complete a change? This question is challenging\r\nbecause on the performance of maintainers, the effects of whether design\r\npatterns are pre-deployed are naturally intertwined with that of\r\nmaintainers' experience and skills.\r\n\r\nWe empirically investigate this question in two phases. In the first\r\nphase, we investigate how likely the maintainers will utilize the deployed\r\ndesign patterns. We have conducted a study of maintainers completing\r\ndifferent kinds of changes on different pattern-deployed programs. Our\r\nresults show that the utilization rate of deployed design patterns can be\r\n100%. In average cases, that rate in correct programs is significantly\r\nhigher than that in faulty programs. This suggests that those maintainers\r\nwho successfully completed changes tend to utilize deployed design\r\npatterns.\r\n\r\nWhile only changes facilitated by design patterns were studied in the\r\nfirst phase, we also studied changes without the facilitation of\r\npre-deployed design patterns in the second phase. We studied two finer\r\nquestions. First, to correctly complete a change, does pre-deploying\r\ndesign patterns lead to faster maintenance than not? If so, would this\r\nfactor be more important than maintainers' experience and skills? We\r\nconducted a controlled experiment that studies the performance of\r\nmaintainers in completing three perfective changes under various factors:\r\nwhether design patterns are pre-deployed, amount of prior exposures to the\r\nprogram, and familiarity with the relevant programming language. Our\r\nresults show that while the factors are individually significant, they are\r\nclosely related.

In the second step, we extend MOLE to multi-AP WMNs and present a\r\ncross-border search technique to shorten search paths between peers\r\nassociated with different APs.

Since different segments may be of different popularity, random\r\nsegment caching would lead to segment popularity-supply mismatch, and\r\nhence uneven workload distribution among peers. Some popular segments may\r\nbe far from peers, leading to inefficient search and streaming. In this\r\npaper, we study optimal segment caching for P2P on-demand streaming. We\r\nfirst formulate the segment caching optimization (SCO) problem, and show\r\nthat it is NP-hard. We then propose a centralized heuristic to solve it,\r\nwhich serves as a benchmark for other algorithms. We propose a distributed\r\ncaching algorithm termed POPCA (POPularity-based Caching Algorithm), in\r\nwhich each peer adaptively and independently replaces segments to minimize\r\nthe popularity-supply discrepancy and the segment distance from peers.\r\nPOPCA also proactively advertises updated segment availability in a\r\nscalable manner to provide near-instant segment search. Through\r\nsimulations and PlanetLab experiments, we show that POPCA achieves\r\nnear-optimal performance, and lower popularity-supply discrepancy and\r\nsegment distance as compared with random caching and sliding window\r\ncaching. Moreover, POPCA has low overhead, and as compared with\r\nDistributed Hash Table (DHT) and biased random walk, achieves lower search\r\nlatency and higher hit rate of finding segments in the peer network in the\r\npresence of peer churn. We also present an analytic model which closely\r\nmatches with the simulation results.

This thesis address the problem of mapping Timed\r\nHomogeneous Synchronous Dataflow(HSDF), a model of computation widely used\r\nin signal processing and streaming applications, onto a multiprocessor\r\nplatform, where multiple processors are connected with a communication\r\nsubstrate with guaranteed latency, e.g. a hard real-time Network-on-Chip,\r\nwith the object of maximizing overall throughput.\r\n\r\nSince this is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, it is\r\ninfeasible to obtain optimal solutions for realistic large-size\r\napplications with exact solution techniques. Instead, we adopt stochastic\r\nsearch techniques, including Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Simulated\r\nAnnealing (SA), to tackle this challenging problem. We use GA or EA to\r\nsearch the design space of possible actor-to-processor mappings and task\r\norderings on each processor, and use graph-theoretic techniques to\r\nevaluate each design point by calculating the maximum throughput for any\r\ngiven actor-to-processor mapping and task ordering.\r\n\r\nWe compare the performance and scalability of the stochastic search\r\ntechniques with exact solution techniques based on SAT solvers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\t\tThursday, 21 August 2008\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t\t10:30a.m.-12:30p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\t\tRoom 5510\r\n\t\t\t\tLifts 25-26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\t\tDr. Zonghua Gu (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\t\tProf. Cunsheng Ding (Chairperson)\r\n\t\t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Application Mapping on Multiprocessor Hardware Platforms with Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing"], "lenArticle": 217},

Analyzing\r\nits causes is an important research topic and visualization tools serve as\r\nthe key component in the weather data analysis. The goal of this thesis is\r\nto build a comprehensive parallel coordinates visualization system for air\r\npollution analysis.\r\n\r\nParallel coordinates is a fundamental visualization technique in\r\ninformation visualization. Three major issues on parallel coordinates are\r\naddressed: visual clutter, dimension ordering and problematic transition.\r\nIn the proposed system, a novel geometric-based clustering algorithm is\r\nproposed to reduce clutter in parallel coordinates. Three graph-based\r\nanalytic tools are developed upon the parallel coordinates: Selection\r\ngraph provides an interface for users to select region of interest in a\r\ncluttered display. Relation graph organizes clusters structurally which is\r\ninformative for users to study inter-cluster relationship. Weighted\r\ncomplete graph aids users to find the optimal axis order based on its\r\nstructure. Problematic transition is alleviated by the proposed non-linear\r\ngrowing technique and morphing transition on common operations in parallel\r\ncoordinates. An analysis is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness\r\nof the proposed system using the real weather data in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\t\tTuesday, 26 August 2008\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t\t2:00p.m.-4:00p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\t\tRoom 3301A\r\n\t\t\t\tLifts 17-18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\t\tDr. Huamin Qu (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo (Chairperson)\r\n\t\t\t\tDr. Pedro Sander\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["A comprehensive parallel coordinates system for air pollution analysis"], "lenArticle": 234},

As performance is one of the primal\r\ndemands of such real-time rendering systems, many researchers have\r\nfocused on general and special techniques for accelerating the process,\r\nresulting in a multitude of different algorithms. In particular,\r\nalgorithms that are based on or manipulate images receive special\r\nattention, due to their simplicity in both representation and\r\nimplementation.\r\n\r\nThis report gives an overview of the present image-space techniques used\r\nfor accelerating general real-time rendering tasks. The techniques are\r\ncategorized into four basic acceleration methodologies: simplifying\r\ndata, removing futile data, reusing duplicated computation, and trading\r\nquality for speed. For each of the types, relevant techniques from the\r\ngroundbreaking ones to the state-of-the-art ones are reviewed in\r\ndetails, grouped by their problem-solving strategies. The strengths and\r\nweaknesses of the methods are also discussed, together with their\r\nrelationship to other approaches.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of the techniques in discussion varies dramatically\r\nwhen applied to different applications. Each technique has its own\r\nconstraints on scene complexity, type of motion, hardware support, and\r\nbottleneck type. At the end of this report, we will review and compare\r\ndifferent approaches in a table. Their targets, limitations and\r\nartifacts are highlighted for facilitating technique selection as well\r\nas exposing promising areas for algorithmic improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:     \t\tTuesday, 26 August 2008\r\n\r\nTime:                   4:00p.m.-6:00p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3304\r\n\t\t\tlifts 17-18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Pedro Sander (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\tDr. Chi-Keung Tang (Chairperson)\r\n\t\t\tDr. Huamin Qu\r\n\t\t\tProf. Long Quan\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Image-Space Acceleration for Real-Time Rendering"], "lenArticle": 270},

Rank aggregation arises in many\r\napplications of various disciplines, such like candidate voting in social\r\nscience, web search and database query in computer science, seriation in\r\npaleontology, and etc.  Different applications may lead to rank\r\naggregation problems with different settings, and under some settings, no\r\nsatisfying rank aggregation methods have been found yet. In addition, the\r\nfundamental issue of rank aggregation is concerned with the aggregation\r\nrules. Some aggregation rules can ensure the generation of the aggregated\r\nrankings with desirable properties. However, the corresponding rank\r\naggregation problems may be quite complicated, even NP-hard.\r\n\r\nIn this report, we classify current rank aggregation applications into\r\nfour cat- egories based on their problem settings. For each category,\r\nrepresentative rank aggregation methods are reviewed with the focus on\r\nanalyzing the performance with respect to the aggregation rules.

In the meanwhile, handheld devices,\r\nespecially PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), are becoming more and more\r\npowerful and popular.  Therefore, we envision that in some applications,\r\nhandheld devices will be commonly used to query deployed WSNs. However,\r\nthere has been little work on developing a lightweight query processor for\r\nPDAs to query sensor networks.  To address this problem, we propose\r\nWinyDB, a relational query processing system on Windows-CE based PDAs for\r\nsensor networks.\r\n\r\nOne of the main features of WinyDB is that multiple PDAs running WinyDB\r\ncan answer queries collaboratively. This collaborative query processing\r\nfeature is useful in that it improves both the power efficiency and the\r\ndata quality. We have proposed collaborative query processing techniques\r\nto handle selection, projection, aggregation, and window join queries.\r\nFurthermore, we have implemented the entire WinyDB system on Windows-CE\r\nbased PDAs.  Our experiments with the system running on multiple PDAs\r\nquerying simulated sensor networks have shown promising results on\r\ncollaborative query processing.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\t\tFriday, 29 August 2008\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t\t3:00p.m.-5:00p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\t\tRoom 3304\r\n\t\t\t\tLifts 17-18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\t\tDr. Qiong Luo (Supervisor)\r\n\t\t\t\tProf. Lionel Ni (Chairperson)\r\n\t\t\t\tDr. Gary Chan\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["WinyDB: Collaboratively Querying Sensor Networks through Handheld Devices"], "lenArticle": 227},

In a typical multiple-user environment, different users may \r\nseverely interfere with each other. How to reduce the coordination \r\noverhead in order to improve the efficiency of the wireless networks \r\nbecomes a big challenge.\r\n\r\nUnlike the wired counterpart, a wireless link is easily affected by \r\nenvironment changes and surrounding wireless activities. Determining the \r\ninstant link conditions (or qualities) is essential for most protocol \r\ndesigns and application developments in wireless communications. In \r\nprevious studies, link-level metrics are utilized to reflect the link \r\nconditions such as Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), \r\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Signal-to-Interference plus Noise-Ratio \r\n(SINR). In practice, however, these metrics exhibit many limitations and \r\ncould be misleading. As they are often the statistic measurements over the \r\npacket transmission while the link conditions may vary dramatically, the \r\npacket-level metrics are unable to indicate the instant link condition. \r\nMotivated by this, we propose to use more fine-grained information from \r\nthe lower layer of the network protocol stack. A chip is an accessible \r\nelement at the physical layer for many wireless standards such as IEEE \r\n802.15.4 and 802.11b. In these standards, information bits are repackaged \r\nas certain sequences of chips before being transmitted over the air. As \r\nthe chip duration is much shorter, it is more capable to capture the \r\ninstant channel changes. Analyzing the chip-level error characteristics \r\nbrings a new measure for the upper-layer network design such as the \r\nnetwork diagnosis, transmission power control, routing, localization and \r\ntopology control.\r\n\r\nWith the interesting observation that by generating intended patterns, \r\nsome simultaneous transmissions, i.e., \u201dinterference\u201d, can be successfully \r\ndecoded without degrading the effective throughput in original \r\ntransmission. An extra and \u201dfree\u201d coordination channel is thus designed \r\nbased on the coding redundancy in DSSS. Based on this idea we propose a \r\nDC-MAC to leverage this \u201dfree\u201d channel for efficient medium access in a \r\nmultiple-user wireless network. I also theoretically analyze the capacity \r\nof this channel under different environments with various modulation \r\nschemes.\r\n\r\nHowever, the previous Side Channel design is based on the coding \r\nredundancy in DSSS which cannot work in OFDM-based WLANs. I then propose a \r\nnew communication model where the control frames can be \u201dattached\u201d to the \r\ndata transmission. Thus, control messages and data traffic can be \r\ntransmitted simultaneously and consequently the channel utilization can be \r\nimproved significantly. I implement the idea in OFDM-based WLANs called \r\nhJam, which fully explores the physical layer features of the OFDM \r\nmodulation method and allows one data packet and a number of control \r\nmessages to be transmitted together.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 2 June 2011\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3494\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Qingping Sun (MECH)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Lionel Ni (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung\r\n \t\t\tProf. Qian Zhang\r\n                      \tProf. Furong Gao (CBME)\r\n                         Prof. Jiannong Cao (Computing, PolyU.)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Communication over interference in wireless networks"], "lenArticle": 498},

Great attention from both academia and industry has\r\nbeen devoted into this area. With users not only downloading data but also\r\nuploading data to others, such peer-assisted systems are easy to deploy\r\nand have good scalability. However, due to the highly dynamic nature of\r\ndistributed peers with heterogeneous capacities and diverse behaviors,\r\nthere still remain several fundamental challenges in large-scale\r\npeer-assisted content distribution and video streaming systems, with\r\nrespect to the cost-performance trade-off in peer-assisted online hosting\r\nand distribution, and the flash crowd problem in P2P live streaming, as\r\nwell as the service qualities of peer-assisted VoD. This proposal seeks to\r\naddress these challenges through not only mathematical modeling and\r\nanalysis, but also practical system design and measurement, in order to\r\nbridge theory and practice.\r\n\r\nFirst, to guarantee adequate levels of service quality while conserving\r\nprohibitive server costs, we seek to explore the design space of online\r\nhosting and distribution systems that integrate peer bandwidth\r\ncontributions with strategic server resource provisioning in a\r\ncomplementary and transparent manner. Specifically, we first model and\r\nanalyze new strategies to allocate scarce server resources ?? including\r\nboth storage space and bandwidth ?? in peer-assisted online hosting\r\nsystems. The objective is to maximize the use of limited server storage\r\nand bandwidth resources to guarantee adequate levels of file availability\r\nand downloading performance, while taking full advantage of peer\r\nassistance. We identify a number of unique challenges involved in such\r\nsystems, and propose our design of resource allocation protocols to\r\naddress these challenges. Based on the guidelines derived from our\r\nanalysis, we design and measure FS2You, a large-scale and real-world\r\nonline hosting system with peer bandwidth assistance and semi-persistent\r\nfile availability. FS2You is designed to dramatically mitigate server\r\nbandwidth costs. We present our architectural and protocol design, as well\r\nas an extensive measurement study at a large scale to demonstrate the\r\neffectiveness of our design, using real-world traces that we have\r\ncollected. To our knowledge, our work represents the first attempt to\r\ndesign, implement, and evaluate a new peer-assisted semi-persistent online\r\nhosting system at a realistic scale. Since the launch of FS2You, it has\r\nquickly become one of the most popular online hosting systems in mainland\r\nChina, and a favorite in many online forums across the country.\r\n\r\nSecond, it is evident from our experiences with real-world P2P live\r\nstreaming systems that, it is not uncommon to have hundreds of thousands\r\nof users trying to join a program in the first few minutes of a live\r\nbroadcast. This phenomenon, unique in live streaming systems, referred to\r\nas the flash crowd, poses significant challenges in the system scalability\r\nand user experience. We develop a mathematical model to capture and\r\nunderstand the inherent relationship between time and scale in P2P\r\nstreaming systems under the flash crowd. Specifically, we show that there\r\nis a fundamental upper bound on the system scale with respect to a time\r\nconstraint. In addition, our analysis has brought forth an in-depth\r\nunderstanding on the effect from the gossip protocol and churn effects. To\r\nour knowledge, our work represents the first attempt to provide an\r\nanalytical characterization and understanding of the inherent scale-time\r\nrelationship in P2P streaming systems, with a particular focus on the\r\nflash crowd and various critical factors.\r\n\r\nThird, due to the lack of theoretical foundation and new storage and\r\ntransmission mechanisms, the service qualities ?? including the video\r\nstreaming bit rates and the startup and seek latencies ?? provided by\r\ncurrent peer-assisted VoD systems are still far from optimum. In practice,\r\nwe design, implement, fine-tune and measure Novasky, a real-world VoD\r\nsystem capable of delivering cinematic-quality video streams to end users.\r\nThe foundation of the Novasky design is a P2P storage cloud, storing and\r\nrefreshing media streams in a decentralized fashion using local storage\r\nspaces of end users. Different from existing peer-assisted VoD systems, it\r\nfeatures a new peer storage and replacement algorithm using Reed-Solomon\r\ncodes and an adaptive server push-to-peer strategy. It has been deployed\r\nin the Tsinghua University campus network, operational since September\r\n2009, attracting 10,000 users to date, and providing over 1,000 DVD or\r\n720p video streams with bit rates of 1 ?? 2 Mbps. Based on real-world\r\ntraces collected over 6 months, we show that Novasky can achieve rapid\r\nstartups within 4 ?? 9 seconds, and extremely short seek latencies within 3\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we plan to develop a theoretical framework based on queueing\r\nmodels, in order to (1) justify the superiority of service prioritization\r\nbased on a taxonomy of requests, and (2) understand the fundamental\r\nprinciples behind optimal caching and prefetching designs in peer-assisted\r\nVoD systems. The focus is to instruct how limited uploading bandwidth\r\nresources and peer caching capacities can be utilized most efficiently to\r\nachieve better system performance. Specifically, we will first use\r\npriority queueing analysis to prove how service quality and user\r\nexperience can be statistically guaranteed, by prioritizing requests in\r\nthe order of significance, including urgent playback (e.g., random seeks\r\nor initial startup), normal playback, and prefetching. We will then\r\nproceed to construct a fine-grained stochastic supply-demand model to\r\ninvestigate peer caching and prefetching as a global optimization problem.\r\nWe believe that such studies can not only provide insights in\r\nunderstanding the fundamental characterization of demand, but also offer\r\nguidelines towards optimal caching and prefetching strategies in\r\npeer-assisted VoD systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:  \t\t\tTuesday, 7 September 2010\r\n\r\nTime:           \t2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:          \tRoom 4480\r\n \t\t\tlifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Bo Li (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Qian Zhang (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lin Gu\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Large-Scale Peer-Assisted Online Hosting, Distribution and Video Streaming Systems: Design, Modeling and Practice"], "lenArticle": 966},

It is a great opportunity to \r\nobtain useful information from these social network data. Meanwhile, the \r\ninformation stored in the social networks are under high risk of attack by \r\nvarious malicious users, in other words, people's privacy could be easily \r\nbreached via some domain knowledge. Thus, for a service provider, such as \r\nFacebook and Linkedin, how to publish a privacy preserving graph becomes an \r\nimportant problem. It is essential to protect users' privacy and at the same \r\ntime provide ``useful'' data. Targeting on the privacy preserving graph \r\npublication problem, in this thesis, we propose four graph publishing models \r\nand one collaborative protocol, which cover different aspects of graph \r\npublication issues.\r\n\r\n1) We propose a novel privacy preserving graph construction technique based on \r\nadding noise nodes. This new graph construction algorithm provides privacy \r\nprotection on the individuals in the graph and their attributes as well as \r\nmaintaining good graph utility.\r\n\r\n2) To increase the utilities of the published graph, we also propose a \r\npersonalized protection framework for social networks, which publishes graphs \r\nwith the consideration of users' personalize privacy setting.\r\n\r\n3) After observing the lack of related work on the weighted graph model, which \r\nis general for online social network application, we propose graph protection \r\nmodels which protect\u00a0individuals when the weights on the relationships are \r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n4) We also propose a new protection model for the attacks which are based on \r\nanalyzing the label-structure relationship.\r\n\r\n5) Due to the unavailability of the trusted centralized data owners across \r\nmultiple social graphs,\u00a0we propose a Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC) \r\nprotocol, which securely generates a privacy preserving graph in a distributed \r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nWe conduct extensive experiments for the privacy preserving graph publishing \r\nmodels and the protocol above on various datasets.

Due to the limited bandwidth of electrical switch architectures, \nmany recent proposals turn to adopt optical technologies. However, \nexisting data center optical architectures either have constrained \nport-to-port connectivity or fail to support massive ports required by \nenormous number of data center servers.\n\nIn this thesis paper, we design and implement BigSwitch, a novel data \ncenter switch architecture with optical devices that can achieve massive \nports, arbitrary any-to-any connectivity with simple configurability. \nConsisting of multiple optical virtual switches, which are attached to \nelectrical packet switches respectively, in a ring, BigSwitch inherits the \nbenefits of low cost, power and complexity from optical data center \nnetwork architectures and leverages commercially available optical devices \nto realize our vision of connecting the data center with one big switch. \nOur wavelength assignment algorithms help to break through previous \noptical data center architecture's any-to-any communication bottleneck and \nwavelength switching algorithms have been designed to reassign wavelength \nin terms of changes of traffic demands.\n\nBigSwitch is designed to be a ring physically and a full-mesh logically, \nenabling 'publish-subscribe' style communications and achieving the \naforementioned benefits. We build a fully functional BigSwitch prototype, \nand demonstrate the feasibility, performance and efficiency of our design \nthrough implanting and experimenting on the prototype.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 3 June 2014\n\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm - 4:00pm\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Kai Chen (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tDr. Pan Hui (Chairperson)\n \t\t\tDr. Lin Gu\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["BigSwitch: A Massive-Port Data Center Switch"], "lenArticle": 273},

In some applications, the \nwhole system consists of thousands of sensor nodes. How to guarantee the \nperformance of such systems would be a great challenge. One method to \navoid the problem raised in operating such large scale system is to \nconduct extensive testing by an experiment tool in the real environment. \nIf the developer could obtain energy consumption of the sensor nodes and \ntopology info of the whole sensor system, the performance of the large \nscale WSN system can be fully monitored.\n\t\nWe design a WSN monitoring system, which can be deployed out to detect the \ncommunication and sensing data in WSN. In this system, a script engine is \ndesigned to analysis the row data. And a schema is designed to ensure the \nmonitoring info sequence under low powerful hardware system. After that, \nwe will discuss an application of wireless sensor network, to monitor the \nchannel boundary in a typical area.

Spatio-temporal data of moving \r\nobjects are basically stored as strings, which means traditional string \r\ncompression techniques can be applied for data compression. Traditional string \r\ncompression methods are good in some cases because they are simple and fast. \r\nHowever, these methods ignored the spatio-temporal characteristics of data, \r\nwhich may lead to a better performance of compression. More importantly, the \r\ndata lose all the utility after compression, thus being very inconvenient for \r\nthose data that need to be queried often.

These devices are envisioned as an \nincreasingly important information interface between neighbouring users. A \nprimary cornerstone of such applications is to build up a bridge \nconnecting devices efficiently and effectively. In this thesis proposal, \nwe address two challenging topics in this area named neighbour discovery \nand spatial-awareness device interaction.

In this proposal, we propose theoretically motivated \r\nsymbolic and deep learning models for improvising lyrics in music and we choose \r\nthe genre of hip hop lyrics as our domain. Unlike most other approaches, all \r\nour models are completely unsupervised and do not make use of any linguistic or \r\nphonetic information. Through our work, we model the issues in song lyric \r\nimprovisation using modern statistical language technologies and attempt to \r\nbridge the gap between language and music from a computational perspective.\r\n\r\nWe improvise hip hop lyrics by generating responses to challenges similar to a \r\nfreestyle rap battle, modeling it as a ''transduction'' problem where the \r\nchallenges need to be translated into a response. We propose a novel hidden \r\nMarkov Model (HMM) based rhyme scheme detection module, which identifies the \r\nrhyme scheme within a stanza in a completely unsupervised fashion and use it to \r\nselect training data for our models so as to generate fluent and rhyming \r\nresponses. We choose the framework of transduction grammars, in particular \r\ninversion transduction grammars (ITGs), as our transduction model given their \r\nrepresentational capacity and empirical performance across a spectrum of NLP \r\ntasks. We propose two symbolic models for improvisation based on 1) a token \r\nbased bracketing inversion transduction grammar, and 2) interpolated grammar \r\ninduced using bottom-up token based rule induction and top-down rule \r\nsegmentation strategies. We demonstrate that the interpolated grammar generates \r\nresponses that are more fluent and rhyme better with the challenges according \r\nto human evaluators. We also compare the performance of our models against the \r\nwidely used off-the-shelf phrase base SMT (PBSMT) model upon the same task and \r\nshow that both our models outperform the PBSMT baseline. We also present \r\nsimilar results on Maghrebi French hip hop lyrics demonstrating the language \r\nindependence of our models.\r\n\r\nWe also present a novel deep learning improvisation model based on a fully \r\nbilingual generalization of the monolingual Recursive Auto-Associative Memory \r\n(RAAM) known as Transduction Recursive Auto-Associative Memory (TRAAM). TRAAM \r\nmodels learn soft, context-sensitive generalizations over the structural \r\nrelationships between associated parts of challenge and response raps, while \r\navoiding the exponential complexity costs that symbolic models would require. \r\nIn TRAAM, feature vectors are learned simultaneously using context from both \r\nthe challenge and the response, such that challenge-response association \r\npatterns with similar structure tend to have similar vectors. We argue that the \r\nTRAAM models capture the context-sensitive generalizations that symbolic models \r\nfail to capture and will therefore produce better quality responses.\r\n\r\nLastly, we discuss the challenges in evaluating the performance on the \r\nimprovisation task of evaluating hip hop lyrics as a first step toward \r\ndesigning robust evaluation strategies for improvisation tasks, a relatively \r\nneglected area to date. We discuss our observations regarding inter-evaluator \r\nagreement on judging improvisation quality as a means to better understand the \r\nhigh degree of subjectivity at play in improvisation tasks, thereby enabling \r\nthe design of more discriminative evaluation strategies to drive future model \r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 16 June 2015\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3584\r\n                         lifts 27/28\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dekai Wu (Supervisor)\r\n  \t\t\tProf. Qiang Yang (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung\r\n  \t\t\tProf. Pascale Fung (ECE)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["IMPROVISING HIP HOP LYRICS VIA TRANSDUCTION GRAMMAR INDUCTION"], "lenArticle": 575},

However, many mobile applications on market suffer \nfrom bugs that can cause significant energy waste and performance \ndegradation, thereby losing their competitive edge. Locating these bugs is \nlabor-intensive and thus automated diagnosis is highly desirable. \nUnfortunately, people have limited understanding of these bugs and there \nare no clear criteria to facilitate automated analysis of mobile \napplications' energy efficiency or execution performance. To bridge the \ngap, we conducted two large-scale empirical studies of real-world energy \nand performance bugs from popular Android applications. We studied the \ncharacteristics of these bugs and identified several common causes of \nenergy waste and performance degradation.\n\nFor energy bugs, we observed that (1) forgetting to deactivate device \nsensors or wake locks after use and (2) ineffectively utilizing sensory \ndata can cause serious energy waste. To help developers detect such energy \nbugs, we proposed a dynamic analysis technique GreenDroid. GreenDroid \nautomatically generates user interaction event sequences to systematically \nexecute an Android application for state space exploration. During \nexecution, it tracks the transformation, propagation and consumption of \nsensory data and analyzes whether the data are effectively utilized by the \napplication to bring users perceptible benefits. It also closely monitors \nwhether device sensors and wake locks are properly deactivated after use. \nWe evaluated GreenDroid using 14 popular open-source Android applications. \nGreenDroid successfully located 13 real energy bugs in these applications \nand additionally found two previously-unknown bugs that were later \nconfirmed by developers.\n\nFor performance bugs, we observed that (1) conducting lengthy operations \nin an application's main thread and (2) frequently invoking heavy-weight \nprogram callbacks can seriously reduce the responsiveness of an \napplication. To help developers detect such performance bugs, we designed \na light-weight static analysis technique PerfChecker. PerfChecker \nautomatically scans an Android application's bytecode and identifies a set \nof checkpoints whose efficiency is critical. It then analyzes whether the \ncheckpoints' implementation satisfies the efficiency rules formulated from \nour empirical study. We evaluated PerfChecker with 39 popular and \nlarge-scale Android applications (29 open-source and 10 commercial) and a \nwidely-used library. PerfChecker successfully detected 178 \npreviously-unknown performance bugs, among which 88 were quickly confirmed \nby developers and 20 critical ones were fixed soon afterwards. We also \nconfirmed via comparison experiments that fixing our detected performance \nbugs can significantly improve the performance of the corresponding \napplications.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 18 June 2015\n\nTime:\t\t\t10:00am - 12:00noon\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 4483\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Li Qiu (ECE)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Raymond Wong\n \t\t\tProf. Charles Zhang\n \t\t\tProf. Chi-Ying Tsui (ECE)\n \t\t\tProf. Mauro Pezze (Univ. of Lugano, Switzerland)\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Automated Analysis of Energy Efficiency and Execution Performance for Mobile Applications"], "lenArticle": 467},

The rapid development of microelectronic technology makes RFID tags \r\nsmaller, cheaper, and more powerful, especially in UHF passive RFID technology. \r\nThese remarkable technical advances have resulted in more and more supermarkets \r\nand libraries, such as Walt-Mart and university libraries, introducing RFID \r\ntechniques into their traditional systems.

Unlike sequential programs, concurrent programs may behave \r\nerently even given the same input, making replay techniques for concurrent \r\nprograms much harder than the counterpart for sequential programs. In this \r\nthesis proposal, we target on deterministic reproducing concurrency bugs \r\ntogether with the bug diagnostics given the capability of reproducing the bug.\r\n\r\nThis thesis proposal contains three parts. In the rst part, we provide Stride, \r\na search based deterministic replay technique that improves the e ciency of \r\nrecording of the program execution information. Unlike exiting techniques that \r\neither maintain the exact shared read-write linkages with a large runtime \r\noverhead -line algorithms to search for a feasible interleaved execution, \r\nStride records the bounded shared memory access linkages at runtime and infers \r\nan equivalent interleaving in polynomial time, under the sequential \r\nconsistency(SC) assumption. The recording scheme eliminates the need for \r\nsynchronizing the shared read operations, which results in a signicant overhead \r\nreduction. Comparing to the previous state-of-the-art approach of deterministic \r\nreplay, Stride reduces, on average, 2.5 times of runtime overhead and produces, \r\non average, 3.88 times smaller logs.\r\n\r\nThe second part aims at enabling deterministic replay under relaxed memory \r\nmodels(RMMs), which dominate today's multicore chips. The main obstacle ap- \r\nects caused by the code instrumentation required by replay techniques: The code \r\ninstrumentation may prevent certain hardware optimizations, such as code \r\nreordering and thus, disables the RMM-specic behaviors, leading to poor \r\ncoverage of RMM-specic behaviors. By leveraging the insight that sequential \r\nconsistency (SC) instrumentation is free ects, we reduce RMM instrumentation to \r\nSC instrumenta- tion via auxiliary threads that simulate RMM behaviors. This \r\nleads to a novel code transformation, namely SC-Transformation, which is the \r\nrst to enable safe instrumentation under RMMs with the provable guarantee of \r\nfull coverage, i.e., it does not prevent any execution witnesses permitted by \r\nthe target RMM. We provide a formal characterization of our transformation, and \r\nprove its soundness and completeness w.r.t. TSO and PSO. Our experiments show \r\nthat the overhead ective, in that it successfully captures the buggy execution \r\ntraces of all the 71 RMM-specic bugs we tested for, none of which could be \r\ncaptured atop naive instrumentation due to ects.\r\n\r\nFinally, we provide a method to pinpoint the root cause of a concurrency bug, \r\nwhich is key to xing the bug. Given the capability of bug reproduction, the \r\nlocalization of a concurrency bug is still challenging because of the hundreds \r\nof context-switches and thousands of race pairs in the execution trace. \r\nExisting localization techniques report many false positives or redundancies, \r\nleaving the onus to the programmer to determine whether each report is \r\nresponsible for the triggered bug, which is a laborious and error-prone task. \r\nIn this thesis proposal, we develop a technique that deterministically \r\npinpoints the root cause of concurrency bugs. The high ects of the \r\ncontext-switches within the buggy execution. The method is general, accepting \r\norder violation bugs and latent bugs, and reports no false positives even given \r\na non-concurrency bug. Experiments on real world concurrency bugs show that the \r\nmethod can localize a concurrency bug to one context-switch, from 10 to \r\n6,377,256 context-switches and up to one billion high level race pairs in the \r\nexecution trace.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 22 June 2015\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 2132C\r\n                         lift 19\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Charles Zhang (Supervisor)\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Lin Gu (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung\r\n  \t\t\tProf. Fangzhen Lin\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Deterministic Reproduction of Concurrency Bugs for Bug Diagnostics"], "lenArticle": 599},

Each type of LBS usually relies on some \r\ncomputation based on spatial data (which is termed as spa- tial computation). \r\nFor example, the \u201csearch-nearby\u201d service relies on spatial keyword query to \r\nfind all objects that are near a given query location and contain a given query \r\nkeyword, the \u201cspatial crowdsourcing\u201d service relies on spatial matching to \r\nmatch between tasks and workers, and the \u201ctrace tracking\u201d service relies on \r\ntrajectory data management.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we introduce three techniques for boosting the spatial \r\ncomputations that are central to LBSs, namely the collective spatial keyword \r\nquery which is one type of spatial keyword query and finds a set of spatial \r\nobjects that cover all the given query keywords and have the smallest distance \r\nfrom the query location, worst-case optimized spatial matching which matches \r\ntwo sets of spatial objects with the smallest worst-case cost, and \r\ndirection-preserving trajectory which simplifies the trajectory while \r\npreserving the direction information embedded in the trajectory data.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 23 June 2015\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t3:00pm - 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 2132A\r\n \t\t\tLift 19\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Zhigang Li (MAE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Raymond Wong (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Wilfred Ng\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dimitris Papadias\r\n \t\t\tProf. Xueqing Zhang (CIVL)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Mohamed Mokbel (Univ. of Minnesota)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["ON BOOSTING SPATIAL COMPUTATIONS FOR LOCATION-BASED SERVICES"], "lenArticle": 325},

Collision happens when two or \nmore data packets overlap in the time domain at receiver and none of them \ncan be received correctly. Collision increases packet delivery delay, \ndecreases network throughput and incurs extra energy cost because of \nretransmissions. To tackle collision, researchers propose abundant \nprotocols in Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. The essential idea behind \nthese protocols is to properly coordinate multiple senders to access a \nshared channel and avoid the case where there are two or more senders \naccessing a shared channel simultaneously. While in recent years, an \nincreasing number of protocols are invented to approach collision in the \nphysical layer (PHY). PHY layer demonstrates promising properties, e.g., \npower indicator like RSSI, the effect of capture and constructive \ninterference, which enable us resolve collision from its nature as \nwireless signals.\n\nThis thesis first draws a new logical roadmap along which we understand \nand deal with collision. The roadmap is: collision avoidance -> collision \ntolerance -> collision cancellation -> collision exploitation. We in the \nbeginning avoid collision out of its harm, and then we can just tolerate \nthem with some \"powerful weapons\". After that, we try to cancel collision \nwith more powerful techniques and finally we realize that collision could \nbe utilized to assists us. Guided by this roadmap, the thesis mainly \naddresses collision to achieve energy-efficient scheduling and \nnear-optimal channel utilization, respectively in the stages of collision \navoidance and tolerance.

We target at three scenarios; (i) when the statistics \r\nare computed over a static database, (ii) when we wish to publish histograms \r\nover sensitive data, and (iii) when the statistics are published continuously \r\nover data that are updated by a stream.\r\n\r\nFor the first scenario, we address one-time publishing of non-overlapping \r\ncounts. These statistics are useful in a wide and important range of \r\napplications, including transactional, traffic and medical data analysis. Prior \r\nwork on \u03f5-differential privacy publishes such statistics with prohibitively low \r\nutility in several practical scenarios. Towards this end, we present GS, a \r\nmethod that pre-processes the counts by elaborately grouping and smoothing them \r\nvia averaging. This step acts as a form of preliminary perturbation that \r\ndiminishes sensitivity, and enables GS to achieve \u03f5-differential privacy \r\nthrough low Laplace noise injection. The grouping strategy is dictated by a \r\nsampling mechanism, which minimizes the smoothing perturbation. We demonstrate \r\nthe superiority of GS over its competitors, and confirm its practicality, via \r\nextensive experiments on real datasets.\r\n\r\nFor the second scenario, we focus on the problem of differentially private \r\nhistogram publication, for range-sum query answering. Specifically, we derive a \r\nhistogram from a given dataset, such that (i) it satisfies \u03f5-differential \r\nprivacy, and (ii) it achieves high utility for queries that request the sum of \r\ncontiguous histogram bins. Existing schemes are distinguished into two \r\ncategories: fast but oblivious to utility optimizations that exploit the data \r\ncharacteristics, and data-aware but slow. We are the first to address this \r\nproblem with emphasis on both efficiency and utility. Towards this goal, we \r\nformulate a principled approach, which defines a small set of simple modules, \r\nbased on which we can devise a variety of more complex schemes. We first \r\nexpress the state-of-theart methods in terms of these modules, which allows us \r\nto identify the performance bottlenecks. Next, we design novel efficient and \r\neffective schemes based on non-trivial module combinations. We experimentally \r\nevaluate all mechanisms on three real datasets with diverse characteristics, \r\nand demonstrate the benefits of our proposals over previous work.\r\n\r\nFor the third scenario, we address continuously publishing of non-overlapping \r\ncounts. Numerous applications require continuous publication of statistics for \r\nmonitoring purposes, such as real-time traffic analysis, timely disease \r\noutbreak discovery, and social trends observation. These statistics may be \r\nderived from sensitive user data and, hence, necessitate privacy preservation. \r\nAlthough \u03f5-differential privacy is a notable paradigm for offering strong \r\nprivacy guarantees in statistics publishing, there is limited literature that \r\nadapts this concept to settings where the statistics are computed over an \r\ninfinite stream of \u201cevents\u201d (i.e., data items generated by the users), and \r\npublished periodically. These works aim at hiding a single event over the \r\nentire stream. We argue that, in most practical scenarios, sensitive \r\ninformation is revealed from multiple events occurring at contiguous time \r\ninstances. Towards this end, we put forth the novel notion of w-event privacy \r\nover infinite streams, which protects an event sequence occurring in w \r\nsuccessive time instants. We first formulate our privacy concept, motivate its \r\nimportance, and introduce a methodology for achieving it. We next design two \r\ninstantiations, whose utility is independent of the stream length.

In many multilabel \napplications, structures exist among labels. A popular structure on labels \nis the label hierarchy, which can be achieved with the help of domain \nexperts, or be automatically created from the data using procedures such \nas hierarchical clustering or Bayesian network structure learning. This \nlabel hierarchy may then be arranged as a tree, as in text categorization, \nor more generally, in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), as in the Gene \nOntology orts typically ignore such label structure or can only exploit \nthe dependencies in a label tree.\n\nInstead of a label hierarchy, some implicit structures may exist between \nlabels. For instance, some labels have strong correlations between each \nother. Examples can be found in text categorization that an article on \n\"sports\" may also be labeled \"entertainment\"; and in image classification \nthat an image annotated with \"jungle\" may also be tagged with \"bushes\". \nBesides the presence of label correlations, we may not have access to all \nthe true labels of each training sample in such applications,. For \nexample, many image annotation tasks use crowdsourcing platforms to \ncollect labels. For each image, the workers may only provide a small, \nincomplete set of answers to the queried labels. Existing algorithms are \noften incapable of handling both label correlations and missing labels.\n\nIn this thesis, we introduce various methods that exploit the label \nstructure for multilabel classification. We first explore the use of a \nlabel hierarchy. Specifically, we proposed three works erent aspects of \nthe problem. In the first work, we propose novel multilabel algorithms for \nthe mandatory leaf node prediction problem, in which the prediction paths \nof a given test example are required to end at leaf nodes of the label \nhierarchy. This problem setting is particularly useful when the leaf nodes \nhave much stronger semantic meaning than the internal nodes. In the second \nwork, we discuss proper loss functions for multilabel problem when label \nhierarchies exist, and derive their corresponding Bayes-optimal \nclassifiers. Thirdly, we present a probabilistic framework by \nincorporating hierarchical label constraints via posterior regularization \nsuch that the hierarchical constraints hold in expectation for the output \nlabels during training. For the second kind of label structure, we \nconsider that certain correlations exist between labels. We propose a \nprobabilistic model that can simultaneously capture label correlations and \nhandle missing labels.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 26 June 2015\n\nTime:\t\t\t10:00am - 12:00noon\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 2132C\n \t\t\tLift 10\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Jianzhen Yu (CHEM)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. James Kwok (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Brian Mak\n \t\t\tProf. Qiang Yang\n \t\t\tProf. Shaojie Shen (ECE)\n \t\t\tProf. Dacheng Tao (Univ. of Tech., Australia)\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Multilabel Classification with Label Structures"], "lenArticle": 466},

However, the Internet \nwas originally designed to primarily support pairwise host-to-host \ncommunications and thus is poorly suited for content dissemination among \nmultiple hosts. With video content becoming increasingly dominant and \nvoluminous, the host-centric paradigm reveals its ine ciencies more \nseriously. In recent years, we have seen a variety of attempts to provide \nmore e cient content delivery support orts of content-centric networking \n(CCN) as a clean-slate redesign of the Internet architecture; ii) the wide \nadoption of CDN services; and ering vital support for modern \ndata-intensive applications. We coin all these attempts to make the \nInternet a better platform for content distribution as \nthe\\content-oriented networks\". In this thesis, we address several \nimportant resource management and optimization problems in those \ncontent-oriented networks.\n\nThis thesis consists of three parts. The rst part is about content \nmanagement in CCN. One of the dening features of CCN is pervasive \nin-network caching. The original CCN proposal adopts the ubiquitous-LRU \ncaching scheme, which leads to serious on-path redundancy and poor overall \ncaching performance. We begin with proposing a new caching scheme PCP and \ndemonstrate via trace-driven simulations that PCP outperforms \nubiquitous-LRU in both microscopic and macroscopic views. Apart from PCP, \nmany other new caching schemes have also been proposed. Most of them \nincluding PCP focus on reducing on-path cache redundancy by invoking \neither explicit or implicit cooperations between nodes along the response \npath. ers from issues of scalability and hurdles of uniform enforcement \nerent ASes. To overcome these limitations, we next propose an intra-AS \ncache cooperation scheme iCCS, which commits to eliminating both on-path \n-path cache redundancy within an AS via a periodic independent procedure. \nWe formulate the cooperative redundancy elimination problem CRE-P and then \npropose a distributed greedy algorithm. Through trace-based simulations on \nmultiple realistic network topologies, we show that iCCS signicantly \nshortens the request-response latency and dramatically reduces the amount \nof transit tra c without increasing internal link congestions. After that, \nwe study the content peering problem in CCN by proposing the content-level \npeering model (CPP). With extensive numerical experiments under realistic \nAS-level peering graphs, we nd that interconnectivity of the peering graph \nsignicantly in uences the maximum peering benet, and that cooperative \ncaching yields higher peering benets than local greedy caching but is \nsensitive to parameters like peering link bandwidth and AS-level cache \nsize. The second part is about content multi-homing with multiple CDNs. We \npropose the MCDN-CM model, aiming to make an optimal operating plan for \nthe authoritative CDN by deciding how to supply content requests with \nguaranteed QoS. We show via numerical experiments under realistic settings \nthat MCDN-CM achieves a tremendous cost-saving for the authoritative CDN \ncompared to other approaches. The third part is about tra c management in \ninter-data center network.

This is \r\nlargely because it is difficult to collect bug information to label a \r\ndataset for training a prediction model. We call this problem defect \r\nprediction on unlabeled datasets. Cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) \r\nhas tried to solve this problem by reusing prediction models built by \r\nother projects that have enough historical data. However, CPDP may not \r\nalways build a strong prediction model because of the different \r\ndistributions among datasets. Approaches for defect prediction only using \r\nunlabeled datasets have also tried to address the problem by adopting the \r\nunsupervised learning technique but have one major limitation, the \r\nnecessity for manual effort.\r\n\r\nTo address these limitations, we propose three techniques that can build \r\nprediction models on unlabeled datasets. First, we propose TCA+ that \r\nimproves the prediction performance of CPDP by adopting a state-of-the-art \r\ntransfer learning technique, transfer component analysis (TCA). TCA+ is an \r\nextended TCA to suggest the most appropriate normalization technique \r\nbefore applying TCA for CPDP. Second, we propose heterogeneous defect \r\nprediction (HDP) that enables cross-project defect prediction on projects \r\nwith heterogeneous metric sets. HDP generates the same metric set between \r\ndatasets used in CPDP by matching metrics that have similar distributions. \r\nLastly, we propose CLAMI that enables defect prediction by using only \r\nunlabeled datasets to build prediction models. The key idea of the CLAMI \r\napproach is to generate a training dataset by using the magnitude of \r\nmetric values from an unlabeled dataset.\r\n\r\nOur proposed techniques, TCA+, HDP, and CLAMI, address limitations for \r\ndefect prediction on unlabeled datasets.

Traditionally, top-k query processing was applied for \r\ndealing with the problem of multi-criteria decision making. A user issues \r\na top-k query by involving his/her utility function as the input and \r\nexpects to be recommended k items for the selection. However, in the case \r\nthat the utility function is unknown, top-k queries cannot be utilized to \r\ncapture the users\u2019 requirements. Recently, researchers proposed several \r\nnovel top-k queries such as k-representative skyline queries and k-regret \r\nqueries, which are regarded as the solutions in the case that the utility \r\nfunction is unknown.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is still far away from the end of the story. Due to the \r\ncomplexity issue, most of these novel top-k queries (without utility \r\nfunctions as inputs) cannot be directly applied to the large-scale data \r\nscenario. Specifically, the algorithms for answering these novel top-k \r\nqueries cannot be easily modified to run in a parallel and distributed \r\nplatform. Another problem is that most existing top-k queries are either \r\nrelated to an exact utility function or independent of the users\u2019 utility \r\nfunction. In a more general case, we may have the user\u2019s information \r\npartially. That is, even a user may not be able to provide an exact \r\nutility function, it is possible to obtain his/her partial information \r\nwhich can be used as the input of the queries so as to improve the quality \r\nof the query answers. In all, we conclude these two problems as the \r\nscalability problem and the general personalization problem.\r\n\r\nMotivated by these observations, I propose two directions to address the \r\nscalability and the personalization issue. On one hand, it is possible to \r\nextend those traditional techniques for top-k query processing in the \r\nlarge-scale data scenario. On the other hand, we could design a new type \r\nof top-k queries such that each newly proposed top-k query can be \r\noriginally answered through a distributed computing platform and \r\nincorporates users\u2019 information into the answers. In my thesis, I give an \r\nemphasis on the solutions towards the above two directions.\r\n\r\nLastly, I include my research results on the interactive top-k query \r\nprocessing for solving a subproblem in classification. In particular, I \r\napply the idea of top-k query processing to sample a training dataset of \r\nsize k in classification, one of the most fundamental problems in machine \r\nlearning and data mining. When constructing a training dataset for \r\nclassification, a good sampling strategy is extremely crucial for the \r\nquality of the training dataset. As a result, I introduce an importance \r\nweighted sampling strategy to obtain the set for labeling as well as the \r\nanalysis on the sample complexity of the proposed algorithm.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 29 July 2015\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 2132C\r\n \t\t\tLift 19\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Johnny Sin (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Raymond Wong (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tProf. Qiong Luo\r\n \t\t\tProf. Yu-Hsing Wang (CIVL)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Xuemin Lin (Univ. of NSW, Australia)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["BIG DATA ANALYTICS WITH NOVEL TOP-K QUERY PROCESSING AND CLASSIFICATION"], "lenArticle": 537},

The \r\nstream of each channel is divided into multiple substreams of a certain \r\nbitrate, each of which is pushed via a tree to the servers that subscribe to \r\nthe channel. The critical and challenging issue is then how to optimize the \r\ntopology of the substream trees so as to minimize the maximum channel delay \r\n(dened as the delay from the source to the subscribing servers).\r\n\r\nThere has been little work on the optimization of such multi-source \r\nmulti-channel live streaming network.

Using novel subset sampling, LAAFU is able to \r\nefficiently identify the altered APs and filter them out before \r\nlocalization, hence achieving high accuracy. With the locations, the \r\nfingerprint signal due to the altered APs can be adaptively and \r\ntransparently updated using the non-parametric Gaussian process regression \r\nmethod.

In such a network, the \r\ncontent provider may rent heterogeneous resources (such as streaming and \r\nstorage capacities) from geographically distributed data centers deployed close \r\nto user pools. These data centers (or proxy servers) collaboratively share \r\ncontents with each other to serve their local users. A critical challenge is \r\nhence to optimize movie storage and retrieval to minimize the deployment cost \r\nconsisting of streaming, storage, and network transmission between data \r\ncenters.\r\n\r\nWe propose a novel and effective movie storage and retrieval using linear \r\nsource coding. All the movies are source-encoded once at the repository, by \r\ntaking every q source symbols of movie m to generate n(m) coded symbols. These \r\ncoded symbols are then distributed to the servers in the cloud. Based on a \r\ngeneral and comprehensive cost model, we optimize n(m) and the number of \r\nsymbols to retrieve from remote servers for a local movie request. The optimal \r\nsolution can be efficiently computed with a linear programming (LP) \r\nformulation. Our solution is proved to approach asymptotically the global \r\nminimum cost as q increases. Even when q is low (say, 30), near optimality can \r\nbe achieved. To accommodate large movie pool and system parameter changes, we \r\npropose algorithms for movie grouping and on-line re-optimization which \r\nsignificantly reduce the computational complexity with little compromise on \r\noptimality.

One of the \r\ndrawbacks of these works is that they treat the crowd as the sole \r\ninformation source for the human-intrinsic queries. However, on many \r\napplications, such human-intrinsic queries can be also answered by \r\nmachine-alone systems (i.e. CPUs). On the one hand, the latency of using \r\nHPUs to answer queries is much longer than that of CPUs, and the monetary \r\ncost of HPUs is often high (e.g. crowdsoucing on Amazon Mechanical Turk), \r\nbut on the other hand, the answers obtained from CPUs often have high \r\nuncertainty due to its incapability to recognize humanintrinsic semantics. \r\nTherefore, it is natural to ask why we cannot combine the power of CPUs \r\nand the wisdom of HPUs to answer human-intrinsic queries accurately and \r\nfast, which is exactly the motivation of this work.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, our study covers four following aspects:\r\n1) We propose three a specific human-machine hybrid system;\r\n2) We design a novel crowd-machine hybrid system of uncertain data \r\ncleaning;\r\n3) We study the classic problem of schema mapping in the new crowdsourcing\r\nperspective;\r\nWe validate our solutions through extensive experiments and discuss \r\nseveral interesting\r\nresearch directions of CPU and HPU hybrid systems on data integration.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 7 August 2015\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t4:00pm - 6:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 2131B\r\n \t\t\tLift 19\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Wai-Ho Mow (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Lei Chen (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Pan Hui\r\n \t\t\tProf. Qian Zhang\r\n \t\t\tProf. Xianhua Peng (MATH)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Guoliang Li (Comp.

Numerous \r\nsubsequent applications such as video semantic analysis call for reliable \r\ntracking results. In this thesis, we first delve into a tracker to analyze \r\nthe most influential components for good performance. In particular, we \r\ndecompose a tracker into five parts: motion model, feature extractor, \r\nobservation model, model updater, and ensemble post-processor. We find \r\nthat the feature extractor plays the most important role in a tracker. \r\nAlthough the observation model is the focus of many studies, we find that \r\nit often brings no significant improvement. Moreover, the motion model and \r\nmodel updater contain many details that could affect the result. The \r\nensemble post-processor can also improve the result substantially when the \r\nconstituent trackers have high diversity.\r\n\r\nBased on these analyses, we decide to apply advanced machine learning \r\ntechniques for visual tracking. Particularly, we focus on the feature \r\nlearning and ensemble post-processing parts. In feature learning, we try \r\nthree different approaches which are based on online nonnegative robust \r\ndictionary learning, stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) and \r\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). In the first method, we present an \r\nonline robust non-negative dictionary learning algorithm for updating the \r\nobject templates, and devise a novel online projected gradient descent \r\nmethod to solve the dictionary learning problem. Our algorithm blends the \r\npast information and the current tracking result in a principled way. It \r\ncan automatically detect and reject the occlusion and cluttered \r\nbackground, yielding robust object templates. For the next two methods, we \r\nshare the spirit of transfer learning. We propose to transfer generic \r\nimage and object features which are learned offline to online tracking. \r\nOur first attempt is to train an SDAE using one million auxiliary natural \r\nimages, and then transfer the encoder part of the SDAE as a feature \r\nextractor to online tracking. An additional classifier layer is appended \r\nto the top of the encoder in online tracking, then both the feature \r\nextractor and the classifier can be fine-tuned to adapt to appearance \r\nchanges of the moving object. Our second approach is based on CNN. To \r\ntackle the disadvantages of the previous approach, we utilize a more \r\npowerful deep learning model called CNN. We further improve the vanilla \r\nCNN with objectness pretraining and structure output. Experiments on a \r\nrecent benchmark [79] show the superiority of the proposed methods.\r\n\r\nFor the ensemble post-processor, inspired by some recent studies on \r\ncrowdsourcing, we propose a novel factorial hidden Markov model (FHMM) for \r\naggregating structured output time series data. For efficient online \r\ninference of the FHMM, we devise a conditional particle filter algorithm \r\nby exploiting the structure of the joint posterior distribution of the \r\nhidden variables.

The data often has to be processed in real time with limited \nmemory space. On the other hand, it has been observed that in most cases, \nthe value density of these data is rather low, and they can usually be \ncompacted in a small summary that can be used to serve queries on the \noriginal data without losing much accuracy. Therefore, building various \nsmall summaries over streaming data has received much attention in both \nthe algorithms and database communities in recent years.\n\nThis thesis proposal makes three contributions to this area. First, we \ncontinue the study of building quantile summaries over streaming data. \nThis is a fundamental problem that has been studied for over 30 years, yet \nthere has been limited formal comparison of the competing methods, and no \ncomprehensive study of their performance. In this proposal, we remedy this \ndeficit by providing a taxonomy of different methods, and describe \nefficient implementations. In doing so, we also propose and analyze \nvariations that have not been explicitly studied before, yet which turn \nout to perform the best.\n\nSecond, we revisit another classical problem, which is to build a \npiecewise linear application (PLA) over streaming time series data. Prior \nwork addressed two versions of the problem, where either the PLA consists \nof disjoint segments, or it is required to be a continuous piecewise \nlinear function. However, we observe that neither minimizes the true \nrepresentation size of the PLA, i.e., the number of parameters required to \nrepresent it. In this proposal, we design an algorithm that generates the \noptimal PLA in terms of representation size while meeting the prescribed \nmax-error guarantee.\n\nThirdly, we propose a new type of summaries, called persistent data \nsketching. All existing data summaries are updated upon the arrival of \nevery element in the stream, thus destroying its previous version. A \npersistent sketch, on the other hand, preserves all its previous versions \nas it is updated over time. Every update creates a new version, while all \nthe versions are kept compactly so that any previous version can still be \nqueried. This gives the summary the ability to answer queries about the \nstream at any prior time.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 18 August 2015\n\nTime:                   10:00am - 12:00noon\n\nVenue:                  Room 2132B\n                        lift 19\n\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Ke Yi (Supervisor)\n  \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong (Chairperson)\n \t\t\tProf. Siu-Wing Cheng\n  \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Building Summaries over Streaming Data"], "lenArticle": 419},

Additional related secondary task(s) acts \r\nas regularizer(s) to help improve the generalization performance of each singly \r\nlearning task; the effect is more prominent when the amount of training data is \r\nrelatively small. Recently, deep neural network (DNN) is widely utilized for \r\nacoustic modeling in ASR. The hidden layers of DNN are ideal internal \r\nrepresentation for the shared knowledge. The main contribution of this thesis \r\nis proposing three methods of applying MTL to DNN for acoustic modeling to \r\nexploit extra information from the related tasks, meanwhile imposing the \r\nguideline that the secondary tasks should not require additional language \r\nresources, which is a great benefit when language resources are limited.\r\n\r\nIn the first method, phone and grapheme acoustic models are trained together \r\nwithin the same deep neural network. The extra information is the \r\nphone-to-grapheme mappings, which is confirmed by analysis and visualization of \r\nimplicit phone-to-grapheme correlation matrix computed from the model \r\nparameters. The training convergence curve also shows that MTL training \r\ngeneralizes better to unseen data than common single task learning does. \r\nMoreover, two extensions are proposed to further improve the performance.\r\n\r\nState tying to some extent relieves the data scarcity problem in \r\ncontext-dependent acoustic modeling. However, quantization errors are \r\ninevitably introduced. The second MTL method in this thesis aims at robust \r\nmodeling of a large set of distinct contextdependent acoustic units. More \r\nspecifically, distinct triphone states are trained with a smaller set of \r\ntied-states, benefiting from better inductive bias to reach a better optimum. \r\nIn return, they embed more contextual information into the hidden layers of the \r\nMTL-DNN acoustic models.\r\n\r\nOur last method works in a multi-lingual setting when data of multiple \r\nlanguages are available. Multi-lingual acoustic modeling is improved by \r\nlearning a universal phone set (UPS) modeling task together with \r\nlanguage-specific triphones modeling tasks to help implicitly map the phones of \r\nmultiple languages to each other.\r\n\r\nMTL methods were proved to be effective on a board range of data sets. The \r\ncontributions of this thesis include the three proposed MTL methods, and the \r\nheuristic guidelines we impose to find helpful secondary tasks. With the \r\nsuccessful explorations, we hope to stimulate more interest of MTL in improving \r\nASR, and our results show that it is promising for wider applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 19 August 2015\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:30am - 12:30pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 2130B\r\n \t\t\tLift 19\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Patrick Yue (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Brian Mak (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. James Kwok\r\n \t\t\tProf. Raymond Wong\r\n \t\t\tProf. Chi-Ying Tsui (ECE)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Pak-Chung Ching (Elec.

Inspired by the effectiveness and aesthetic appeal of \r\nhuman line drawings, researchers have investigated algorithms for generating \r\nline drawings from 3D meshes. Almost all such techniques focus on only the end \r\nproduct; very few regard the line drawings as a creative process. The creation \r\nprocess of a drawing provides a vivid visual progression, allowing the audience \r\nto better comprehend the drawing. It also enables numerous stroke-based \r\nrendering techniques.\r\n\r\nIn this dissertation, we address the problem of simulating the process of \r\nobservational drawing; that is, what and how people draw when sketching. Given \r\na 3D model and a viewpoint, our method synthesizes a visually plausible \r\nsimulation of an observational sketching process. To conveniently change the \r\nview, we design a novel touch-based interface that supports six degrees of \r\nfreedom 3D direct manipulation while requiring only two-finger operations.\r\n\r\nWe develop structure-aware shape analysis methods to obtain the intended \r\ndrawing trajectories for organic objects and urban scenes separately, which \r\naddress the question of what do people draw. Apart from the trajectories that \r\ndepict visual features using conventional local geometric properties, we focus \r\non the auxiliary trajectories indicating the composition of the drawing. We \r\nextract the auxiliary trajectories from contextual properties such as the \r\ntopological layout, proportions of object parts, fitted primitives, partial \r\nsymmetries, and levels of abstractions.\r\n\r\nWe develop the humanized stroke synthesis and stroke ordering methods to \r\naddress the question of how do people draw. The stroke synthesis method \r\nsimulates the action of a human moving a pen along an intended trajectory using \r\na feedback control system. It produces human-like tentative strokes with \r\ninexact tracing and retracing effects. To assign a drawing order to the \r\nstrokes, we view the sketching process as analogous to an information delivery \r\nprocess. A novel concept of sketching entropy, which measures the shape \r\ninformation of a stroke, is introduced. We obtain the complete drawing order by \r\nrequiring every next drawn stroke to maximize the information gain. Finally, we \r\nuse the humanized strokes and their ordering to create the sketching animation.\r\n\r\nWe conduct a user study to evaluate the visual plausibility of the simulated \r\ndrawing processes and the effectiveness of our proposed method. Experiment \r\nconfirms that our results are visually plausible. The statistical analysis \r\nshows that our entropy-based ordering strategy leads to more plausible results \r\nthan those driven by the conventional Gestalt rules used in previous works.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 24 August 2015\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 2131C\r\n \t\t\tLift 19\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Robert Ko (LIFS)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Chiew-Lan Tai (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Chi-Shing Chung\r\n \t\t\tProf. Long Quan\r\n \t\t\tProf. Shuhuai Yao (MAE)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Pheng-Ann Heng (Comp.

It is generally recognized that a complex \r\nlarge-scale task has to be decomposed into smaller HITs (Human Intelligence \r\nTasks) before it can be crowdsourced. This raises the question of how to \r\nperform this task decomposition best. It turns out that creating HITs that are \r\ntoo large results in poor answer quality while creating HITs that are too small \r\nincurs unnecessary cost. In this study, we propose a smart large scale task \r\ndecomposition scheme in crowdsourcing systems, to effectively decompose a \r\nlarge-scale task into a set of HITs to achieve a result that is both \r\ncosteffective and accurate.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we define the Effective Decomposition Problem (ED Problem) and \r\nprove its NP-hardness. Then, we investigate this hard problem from two \r\nscenarios. In the first scenario, all tasks have the same quality threshold, \r\nand we propose two efficient and effective approximation algorithms using \r\ngreedy strategy and optimal priority queue structure to find a near-optimal \r\nsolution. In the second scenario, quality thresholds of different tasks are \r\ndifferent, and we extend the approximation algorithms proposed for the first \r\nscenario by using partitioning strategy.

The objective is to partition data into meaningful clusters, \r\nwhere the number of clusters might be known or unknown. A variety of \r\napproaches have been proposed for the task. Examples include \r\ndistance/similarity-based algorithms such as K-means, kernel K-means and \r\nspectral clustering, as well as model-based methods such as Gaussian \r\nmixture models (GMMs). Most previous clustering algorithms are targeted \r\nfor continuous data, that is, points in the Euclidean space of certain \r\ndimension. In this thesis, we focus on discrete data where each attribute \r\ntakes a nite number of possible values.\r\n\r\nA commonly used method for clustering discrete data is latent class \r\nanalysis (LCA). LCA is based on a class of nite mixture models known as \r\nlatent class models (LCMs). An LCM consists of a latent variable and a \r\nnumber of attributes. It assumes that the attributes are mutually \r\nindependent given the latent variable. Known as local independence, this \r\nassumption is often too strong in practice, and might lead to spurious \r\nclusters. Another method for clustering discrete data is called latent \r\ntree analysis (LTA) and it is based latent tree models (LTMs). LTMs allow \r\nmultiple latent variables and hence the local independence is relaxed. \r\nEach latent variable represents a soft partition of data. As such, LTA \r\nyields multiple partitions of data and is multidimensional clustering \r\nmethod. While multiple partitions are desirable in some applications, \r\nthere are many situations where one wants only one partition of data.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we develop and investigate a novel method for clustering \r\ndiscrete data that yields a single partition of data and does not make the \r\nlocal independence assumption. The method learns, from data, a three-level \r\nLTM where (1) the attributes are at the bottom, (2) there is a unique \r\nlatent variable, the root, at the top level, and (3) there are multiple \r\nlatent variables at the middle level that connect the attributes and the \r\nroot. The root represents the data partition to be obtained. The local \r\nindependence assumption is relaxed by the multiple latent variables at the \r\nmiddle level. The method is called UC-LTM, which stands for unidimensional \r\nclustering based on latent tree models.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the general-purpose algorithm UC-LTM, we also propose and \r\ninvestigate a special-purpose unidimensional clustering method for solving \r\nthe rounding problem of spectral clustering. Spectral clustering starts \r\nwith a similarity matrix for a collection of data points, transforms the \r\nmatrix to get the so-called Laplacian matrix, nds the eigenvectors of the \r\nLaplacian matrix, and obtains a partition of the data points using the \r\nleading eigenvectors. The last step is called rounding and it consists of \r\nthree subproblems: (1) decide how many leading eigenvectors to use, (2) \r\ndetermine the number of clusters, and (3) partition the data points. To \r\nsolve the rounding problem, we treat the eigenvectors as features, \r\ndiscretize them, and then learn a three-level LTM to cluster the ers from \r\nprevious rounding methods in three ways. First, we relax the assumption \r\nthat the number of clusters equals the number of eigenvectors used. \r\nSecond, when deciding how many leading eigenvectors to use, we not only \r\nrely on information contained in the leading eigenvectors themselves, but \r\nalso make use of the subsequent eigenvectors. Third, our method is \r\nmodel-based and solves all the three sub-problems simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 24 August 2015\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 2132C\r\n \t\t\tLift 19\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Shaohui Zheng (ISOM)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Nevin Zhang (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tProf. Fangzhen Lin\r\n \t\t\tProf. Raymond Wong (SOSC)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Changhe Yuan (Comp.

Traditional network \r\narchitectures are ill-suited to meet the requirements of enterprises and \r\nusers. By decoupling the control plane and the data plane, Software \r\nDefined Networking (SDN) is proposed to enable network innovation with \r\nunprecedented programmability. Specifically, the flexibility of SDN \r\nsignificantly facilitates network measurement and monitoring.\r\n\r\nDespite these advantages, many issues remain unresolved in SDN. Firstly, \r\nas a forwarding component, the performance of the logically centralized \r\ncontroller is a major concern. Since the number of mice flows contributes \r\nto a considerable fraction of the total number of flows, the frequent \r\ninvocations of the controller may result in a high flow setup latency. \r\nSecondly, to perform software defined measurement tasks, the precious TCAM \r\nentries are required to monitor corresponding flow set. Moreover, the \r\ncontroller collects flow statistics from the switches by periodic polling, \r\nwhich incurs measurement overhead on the network. The challenge is how to \r\nconduct high-accuracy software defined measurement at minimum cost.\r\n\r\nTo address the first challenge, we propose CheetahFlow, which predicts \r\nfrequent communication pair and proactively installs forwarding wildcard \r\nrules to eliminate the extra flow setup latency. Particularly, the \r\nblocking island paradigm is employed to reroute elephant flows to a \r\nnon-congested path to further reduce the flow setup latency.\r\n\r\nTo resolve the second challenge, we propose several novel schemes in a \r\ntop-down manner. In the first place, we propose COSTA, a cross-layer \r\noptimization for sketch-based measurement, which works in the application \r\nand the management layers. By sacrificing a small amount of accuracy, \r\nCOSTA dramatically shrinks the measurement resource usage. We formulate \r\nthe measurement task assignment problem as a mixed integer nonlinear \r\nprogramming problem, and develop a two-stage heuristic to efficiently \r\nassign concurrent measurement tasks. In the second place, we propose \r\nCeMon, a cost-effective flow statistics polling scheme which is a \r\nshim-layer between the management and the physical layers. We point out \r\nthat flow statistics polling is a fundamental primitive for software \r\ndefined measurement. Then, we propose a generic optimization which is \r\ncompatible with all existing measurement frameworks. CeMon presents two \r\nmonitoring schemes to achieve different levels of measurement granularity. \r\nIn particular, the maximum coverage polling scheme collects the statistics \r\nof all active flows, while the adaptive fine-grained polling scheme \r\ntargets at polling the statistics of a small set of flows. Both \r\ntheoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness \r\nof our proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 28 August 2015\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 2132B\r\n                         lift 19\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Mounir Hamdi (Supervisor)\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Kai Chen (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Gary Chan\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Efficiency Optimization for Software Defined Networking"], "lenArticle": 451},

To support the ever-growing cloud computing needs, \r\nthe number of physical servers and virtual machines in today's data \r\ncenters are increasing exponentially, which in turn leads to enormous \r\nchallenges in designing cost-effective data center networks (DCNs) and \r\nefficient resource sharing via network provisioning. With data \r\navailability and security at stake, the issues with data center networks \r\nare more critical than ever. As one of the most important determinants of \r\nnetwork performance, the data center network architecture plays a dominant \r\nrole in determining the system reliability, network capacity, latency and \r\neven the routing efficiency. With this motivation, in this thesis paper, \r\nwe firstly present the design, implementation and evaluation of SprintNet, \r\na novel server-centric network architecture for data centers. SprintNet \r\nachieves high performance in network capacity, fault tolerance, and \r\nnetwork latency. SprintNet is also a scalable, yet low-diameter network \r\narchitecture where the longest path length of SprintNet can be limited by \r\nfour hops and is independent of the number of layers. Subsequently, \r\nanother agile and cost-effective server-centric architecture, termed \r\nJieLin, is proposed. JieLin not only is highlighted by its excellent \r\nscalability of O(n*(an)(k-1)), but also demonstrates high performance in \r\nbisection bandwidth, fault tolerance and average path length. Furthermore, \r\nin response to the critical shortcomings of the server-centric \r\narchitectures, we then propose an effective hardware based approach to \r\nsolve these issues and improve the network efficiency. Afterwards, we \r\ndesign two torus-based DCN architectures named NovaCube and CLOT, where \r\nthe torus topology well implements the network locality forming the \r\nservers in close proximity of each other, which increases the \r\ncommunication efficiency. Moreover, in the highly multiplexed shared cloud \r\ndata centers, in order to efficiently share the physical network resources \r\namong multiple tenants that have diversified virtual network topologies \r\nwith different network characteristics, in this thesis we then propose an \r\nefficient online heuristic virtual network embedding framework called \r\nPresto, adopting an artificial intelligence resource abstraction model \r\nnamed Blocking Island. Presto operates with quite low computation \r\ncomplexity and greatly reduces the search space, which far outperforms \r\nother candidates. The goal of Presto is to maximize the economic revenue \r\nof infrastructure providers and increase the resource utilization while \r\nminimizing the embedding cost. Finally, we propose two efficient heuristic \r\nschemes to achieve an energy proportional data center network from the \r\nperspective of resource allocation, routing and flow scheduling, without \r\ncompromising throughput and fault tolerance too much.

A context refers to the environment around a user\r\nthat reflects or affects the user's search goal. Web search\r\npersonalization is the process that allows a search engine to adapt the\r\nsearch results to user's specific goal by incorporating user's context\r\ninformation beyond the query provided. Effective search engine\r\npersonalization techniques involve two major challenges: (1) accurately\r\nidentifying the user context and (2) model the context information such\r\nthat it can be effectively integrated into the existed information\r\nretrieval model, by which the search results can be organized in a way\r\nthat can match the particular context of the user. This paper presents a\r\nsystematic literature survey on state-of-the-art search engine\r\npersonalization techniques focusing on the above two challenges. First, we\r\nreview some classical retrieval models (e.g. the vector space model, Okapi\r\nBM25, Kullback-Leibler divergence).We then introduce several types of\r\ncontexts which may differentiate a user from others when he/she performs\r\nsearch, e.g., the short term search session, the long term search history,\r\nuser??s click-through history, the geographic location influence, the\r\nsocial influence, etc. With respect to each type of context, we introduce\r\nmethods to model it and to incorporate it into the existed retrieval\r\nmodel, by which personalization effects can be achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 11 September 2013\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3402\r\n                         lifts 17/18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dik-Lun Lee (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Wilfred Ng (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\r\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Survey on Personalized Information Retrieval"], "lenArticle": 303},

Despite of their success, most previous \r\nresearch works focus on analyzing individual networks. However, data in \r\nindividual networks can be quite sparse and each individual social network \r\nmay reflect only partial aspects of users' social behaviors. Building \r\nmodels on such networks may overfit the rare observations and fail to \r\ncapture the whole picture of users' social interests. In reality, nowadays \r\npeople join multiple networks for different purposes. For example, users \r\nmay use Facebook to connect with their friends, talk with their families \r\non Skype and follow celebrities on Twitter, etc. Thus, different networks \r\nare correlated with each other and nested together as composite social \r\nnetworks by the shared users. If we consider these users as the bridge, \r\nfragmented knowledge in individual networks can be utilized collectively \r\nto build more accurate models and obtain comprehensive understandings of \r\nusers' social behaviors.\r\n\r\nIn this research, our main idea is to employ transfer learning, that \r\nextracts common knowledge from different networks to solve the data \r\nsparsity problem but takes care of the network differences. We propose to \r\nbuild a general framework, known as ComSoc, based on hierarchical Bayesian \r\nmodels, by encoding common knowledge and network differences as latent \r\nfactors. Based on this framework, we will research knowledge transfer in \r\ncomposite social networks from four major aspects: 1). how to model the \r\ncomposite network structures; 2). how to model the dynamics and network \r\nco-evolution; 3). how to adaptively predict users' social behaviors across \r\nsocial medias; and 4). how to measure users' distances specifically in \r\ndifferent networks. We will use large-scale social networking datasets, to \r\ncarry out this research. We will demonstrate how our ComSoc framework can \r\nbe instantiated for solving these four problems. Finally, to handle big \r\ndata, we propose a novel parallel framework that makes the model inference \r\nefficient.

In \r\nthese programs, programmers use the threads to concurrently access the shared \r\nresource and use the locks to synchronize between the threads to guarantee the \r\ncorrectness criteria such as race-freeness.\r\n\r\nIt is very challenging to specify the locks that achieve both goals of the high \r\nperformance and the correctness.

To \nautomate crash reproduction, many approaches have been proposed including \nrecord-replay approaches and post-failure-process approaches. Record-replay \napproaches record software executions and reliably reproduce the recorded \nexecutions.

Alternatively, post-failure-process \napproaches perform analysis on crashes only after they have occurred. Therefore \nthey do not incur performance overhead. However, existing post-failure-process \napproaches still could not reproduce many crashes in practice. In this paper, \nwe propose an automatic crash reproduction framework using collected crash \nstack traces. The proposed approach combines an efficient backward symbolic \nexecution and a novel method sequence composition approach to generate unit \ntest cases that can reproduce the original crashes without incurring additional \nruntime overhead.

For\r\nexample, GPS navigation systems maintain and query road networks to guide\r\ncar-drivers to their destinations; while rescue centers maintain the\r\nterrain information for the purpose of disaster response.\r\n\r\nCompared with Euclidean space, spatial networks are usually a more\r\nrealistic setting for many real world database applications, and thus, it\r\nis very important to support efficient query processing over spatial\r\nnetworks. Many spatial queries that were first studied in the Euclidean\r\nspace have been studied over spatial networks, including nearest neighbor\r\n(NN) queries, reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) queries, aggregate nearest\r\nneighbor (ANN) queries, skyline queries, facility location problem, etc.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this proposal goes beyond those traditional spatial queries,\r\nand we propose to study novel spatial queries that are of special interest\r\nto applications related to spatial networks. This first kind of query is\r\nOptimal Meeting Point (OMP) query that finds the location p that minimizes\r\na cost function defined over the distances from p to all the query points.\r\nApplications of OMP queries include determining the location of a\r\nconference venue, and deciding the pick-up location of a tourist bus. The\r\nsecond kind of query is Distance-Preserving Subgraph (DPS) query which\r\nfinds a subgraph of the spatial network that preserves the shortest path\r\nbetween any two query points. DPS queries are important in route\r\nrecommendation systems, logistics planning, and all kinds of\r\nshortest-path-related applications that run on resource-limited mobile\r\ndevices.\r\n\r\nWe also study Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) that models terrain\r\ndata.

In particular, mining frequent \npatterns is one of the most fundamental problems in traditional data \nmining researches, thus mining frequent patterns over probabilistic \ndatabases has attracted much attention in the database and data mining \ncommunities. In the scenario of probabilistic data, the support of an \npattern is a discrete random variable rather than a frequency of this \npattern. Hence, the frequent pattern under uncertain data has different \ndefinitions due to the variation of probabilistic semantics, which even \ngenerates inconsistent results in current studies. However, the \nrelationship between different definitions and the inconsistent results \nhas not yet been thoroughly identified and explored. Furthermore, like its \ncounterpart, mining frequent patterns in deterministic data, mining \nfrequent patterns over uncertain data cannot avoid an exponential number \nof frequent patterns which cause the mining results less useful. In this \nthesis, we demonstrate how our solution can clarify the problems in \nexisting studies and address the challenge of an exponential number of \nmining results. Moreover, our solution is also well applied to \nconstructing effective indexes for query processing over other types of \nuncertain data, i.e., querying uncertain graphs. Furthermore, with the \nadvent of big data era, we also propose the solution of finding frequent \npatterns in distributed uncertain data. To summarize, our study covers the \nfollowing four aspects:\n\n1) We conduct a comprehensive experimental study of existing \nrepresentative frequent itemset mining algorithms over probabilistic \ndatabases and clarify several existing inconsistent conclusions;\n2) We formalize a novel problem of mining probabilistic frequent closed \nitemsets in an uncertain transaction database and design an efficient \nsolution, which includes a series of pruning techniques and an effective \nsampling algorithm.\n3) We study the problem of efficient probabilistic supergraph containment \nqueryand provide the efficient solution, which integrates probabilistic \nfrequent pattern mining technique for constructing the index.\n4) We propose the problem of finding frequent items in distributed \nprobabilistic data and provide a local thresholds-based deterministic \nalgorithm and a sketch-based sampling method to reduce both communication \nand computation costs.\n\nWe validate our solutions through extensive experiments and discuss \nseveral potential research directions of mining frequent pattern over \nprobabilistic databases.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 6 December 2013\n\nTime:\t\t\t10:00am \u2013 12:00noon\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3494\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Danny Tsang (ECE)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Lei Chen (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Frederick Lochovsky\n \t\t\tProf. Ke Yi\n \t\t\tProf. Weichuan Yu (ECE)\n                        Prof. Jianliang Xu (Comp.

As the rapid development of cloud computing, data center \r\nnetworking and big data, traditional network is ill-suited to meet the \r\nrequirements of today's users and enterprises. In particular, the enormous \r\ndeployed devices which are the critical infrastructure of network make the \r\nInternet extremely difficult to evolve. Moreover, conventional network \r\ndevices are usually integrated black boxes, which hinder network \r\ninnovations such as new protocol design and testing.\r\n\r\nSDN enables programmable network which overcomes the shortcomings of the \r\ntraditional network. It decouples the data-plane and control-plane of the \r\nswitches, making it possible to let these two parts evolve separately. \r\nBesides, network intelligence and states are logically centralized, \r\nproviding the global visibility of the network. Access control, traffic \r\nengineering and quality of service can be achieved uniformly across the \r\nnetwork. Therefore, SDN architecture paves the way for renewing modern \r\nnetwork.\r\n\r\nSDN paradigm is a novel concept, but there are many challenges and open \r\nproblems to solve. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art \r\napproaches on SDN research.

To avoid radio interferences \nand maximize the channel capacity, wireless stations have to exchange control \nmessages to coordinate well. The existing wisdoms of conveying control messages \nconsume valuable communication resources, and introduce massive coordination \noverheads. Therefore, how to provide cost-effective coordination mechanisms \nbecomes a critical problem in wireless design.\n\nIn this thesis, we first present a survey on the recent advances in wireless \ncommunications, including a variety of PHY and MAC layer coordination \nmechanisms, and reviews of classic problems in wireless networks.\n\nThe state-of-the-art expensive coordination mechanisms motivate us to propose a \nnovel PHY layer technique termed Attachment Transmission. It provides an extra \ncontrol panel with minimum overhead. In a traditional transmission paradigm, \ncontrol messages compete for communication resources with data packets.  On the \ncontrary, attachment transmission enable control messages to be transmitted \nalong with data packets, without degrading the effective throughput of the \noriginal data packets.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of the attachment transmission, we apply it to \na number of classic problems in wireless networks, including the multi-channel \nallocation problem in OFDMA-based networks, the hidden and exposed terminal \nproblem in ad-hoc networks, and the multiple access problem in wireless local \narea networks (WLAN). Extensive experiments demonstrate that attachment \ntransmission is capable of exploiting channel redundancy to deliver control \ninformation, thus provides significant support to numerous higher layer \napplications.\n\nIn addition to attachment transmission, we further exploit OFDM subcarriers for \nfine-grained and lightweight control, termed subcarrier control. Subcarrier \ncontrol is categorized into two kinds: subcarrier coordination for cogitative \nradio networks (CRNs) and subcarrier coding for wireless rate adaptation (WRA). \nSubcarrier coordination moves cooperative sensing and multi-channel contention \nfrom time domain into frequency domain, which significantly reduce the control \noverhead. Subcarrier coding aims to conduct fine-grained rate adaptation at \nsubcarrier level, and thus approaches the channel capacity. We validate \nsubcarrier control through extensive experiments, and discuss potential \nresearch directions of fine-grained and lightweight control over wireless \ncommunications.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 8 January 2014\n\nTime:\t\t\t9:30am \u2013 11:30am\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Vladimir Chigrinov (ECE)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Mounir Hamdi (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Gary Chan\n \t\t\tProf. Jogesh Muppala\n \t\t\tProf. Khaled Ben Letaief (ECE)\n                        Prof. Hussein Mouftah (Elec.

New PHY and MAC layer enhancements have been introduced in \r\ndifferent IEEE 802.11 WLAN standards. These improvements have given birth to a \r\nwide range of bandwidth channels (up to 160MHz) and very high transmission data \r\nrates (> 1Gbps) to keep up with current and up- coming multimedia applications. \r\nOptimizing the performance of different wireless networks for emerging network \r\napplications is an important and highly challenging issue.\r\n\r\nQoS is very important for high throughput WLANs. Scheduling the access of flows \r\nin a non-interfering manner to avoid packet loss and adapting rates to changing \r\nchannel conditions are important aspects of QoS in wireless networks. The goal \r\nof the rate adaptation scheme is to select the best set of transmission \r\nparameters for a given user considering its channel quality. Similarly, \r\nsub-channel scheduling access can be seen as selecting the best set of users to \r\nallocate subcarriers according to their channel state information. As data \r\ntraffic has diverse characteristics and different transmission requirements, an \r\nadvanced version of Multimedia-MAC should exist to dynamically adjust the \r\nbandwidth allocation according to the instant traffic load status so that both \r\nnetwork channel utilization and QoS for different types of traffic streams are \r\ndramatically enhanced.\r\n\r\nThis thesis makes two main contributions. The first is a design a new practical \r\nrate control algorithm for 802.11n WLANs, based on a probing system that \r\nguarantees that it is has Long-Term Stability and Short-Term Responsiveness \r\n(L3S). We then implement it in commercial devices using the Ath9k driver \r\nwithout modifications to the existing standard. The new rate adaptation \r\nclassifies transient and sustained changes in the link conditions. Then, it \r\ncontrols both short-term and long-term channel quality variations respectively \r\nby continuously monitoring the transmission history and intelligently probing \r\nat new data rates that may outperform the current one. Our proposed rate \r\ncontrol algorithm adapts rapidly to these changes by adjusting the efficient \r\ntransmission rate. Thus, it optimizes the throughput (or delay) performance on \r\na wireless link. The second part consequently deals with the major reasons for \r\nthe inefficiency of different WLANs. The current MAC layer randomly allocates \r\nthe entire channel to only one user as a single resource. Indeed, one way to \r\nsignificantly improve WLAN performance is to effectively reduce the channel \r\nwidth and create different sized sub-channels. Based on the user\u2019s channel \r\nconditions and QoS requirements, the Physical layer resources can be \r\ndynamically allocated to several users at the same time. Thus, we present a \r\nnovel sub-channels access approach, titled MU-Access, with new features \r\nsuitable for the forthcoming high-speed MIMO-based WLAN products. We shall \r\nevaluate its performance compared to state-of-the-art systems, using NS-3 under \r\na variety of network conditions. Our experiments then demonstrate that our \r\nscheme does indeed enhance IEEE 802.11 device performance with a much higher \r\ndegree of throughput. Also, we propose to profit from the sub-channels access \r\napproach and adapt the rate separately for each block of subcarriers according \r\nto the instantaneous channel conditions, for improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 8 January 2014\r\n\r\nTime:                   11:30am - 1:30pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3494\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Mounir Hamdi (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Gary Chan (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Multiuser Sub-channels Allocation and Rate Adaptation for IEEE 802.11 WLANs"], "lenArticle": 564},

In this thesis proposal, we identify three key challenges \r\nin the wireless networking research in TV white spaces.

Third, we consider the co-existence of systems operating \r\nunder heterogeneous standards in TV white spaces and propose a \r\nbusytone-based approach. In the economic model aspects, we study two \r\nproblems. First, we consider the procedure of TV channel redistribution \r\nand model it as a double auction between sellers and buyers. We propose a \r\ntruthful auction mechanism considering heterogeneous propagation \r\nproperties of the TV spectrum. Second, we study the pricing problem for TV \r\nwhite space database operators and propose a hybrid pricing scheme for the \r\noperators to manage their costs and make profits.

Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) is a newly \ndeveloped empirical algorithm that works on non-stationary and nonlinear \nsignals. In this study, we examine the HHT algorithm for its performance \non Cantonese tone recognition for isolated syllables. Firstly, HHT is used \nas a frequency detection tool applied to syllables from the CUSYL corpus. \nExperimental results show a 25% improvement in the accuracy of the \nfundamental frequency detection compared to peak picking Fast Fourier \ntransform. Secondly, we improve both the performance and the accuracy of \nthe HHT on the CUSYL corpus by experimenting with various parameters used \nby the core component of HHT, the Windowed Average-based Empirical Mode \nDecomposition (WA-BASED EMD). Finally, Support Vector Machines (SVM) are \nused as binary classification tools. Pitch track information obtained by \nHHT together with tone information from the CUSYL corpus is used to train \na set of 6 SVMs with more than 1000 syllables.

In recent years, with the explosion of available data \r\n(e.g. social networks), it\u2019s very common to deal with a complex graph which has \r\nmillions of nodes and billions of edges. To uncover the hidden structure and \r\nextract relevant information from these massive graphs, small dense subgraphs \r\noccurring in the graphs become a basic and valuable tool. \u00a0Specifically, \r\ntriangle is one of the most fundamental small subgraphs: it is the shortest \r\nnon-trivial cycle and the smallest non-trivial clique. The problem of triangle \r\nlisting (or triangle counting) in a simple undirected graph is to list (or \r\ncompute the number of) all triangles. Thereby, listing and counting triangles \r\nappears as a key issue from a theoretical point of view as well as for \r\npractical purposes.\r\n\r\nThe main intention of this survey is to present a general review and analysis \r\nof the existing triangle listing and counting algorithms under the following \r\ncomputational models: the traditional RAM model, the I/O model, the data stream \r\nmodel, and the MapReduce model.

Various studies have been presented to study the \nnetwork structure as well as users' social characteristics. Despite of their \nsuccess, most previous research works focus on analyzing individual networks. \nHowever, data in individual networks can be quite sparse and each individual \nsocial network may reflect only partial aspects of users' social behaviors. \nBuilding models on such networks may overfit the rare observations and fail to \ncapture the whole picture of users' social interests. In reality, people join \nmultiple networks for different purposes. For example, users may use Facebook \nto connect with their friends, talk with their families on Skype and follow \ncelebrities on Twitter, etc. Thus, different networks are correlated with each \nother and nested together as composite social networks by the shared users. If \nwe consider these users as the bridge, fragmented knowledge in individual \nnetworks can be utilized collectively to build more accurate models and obtain \ncomprehensive understandings of users' social behaviors.\n\nIn this research, our main idea is to extract common knowledge from different \nnetworks to solve the data sparsity problem but takes care of the network \ndifferences. We propose a general framework, known as ComSoc, based on \nhierarchical Bayesian models, by encoding common knowledge and network \ndifferences as latent factors. Based on this framework, we analyze composite \nsocial networks from four major aspects: 1). how to model the composite network \nstructures; 2). how to model the dynamics and network co-evolution; 3). how to \nadaptively predict users' social behaviors across social medias; and 4). how to \nmeasure users' distances specifically in different networks. We will use \nlarge-scale social networking datasets, to carry out this research, in order to \ndemonstrate how our ComSoc framework can be instantiated for solving these four \nproblems.

Internet users are increasingly interested in the data rather \nthan the custodian of the data resulting in a mismatch between the current \nInternet architecture and its usage patterns. As a quick-to-deploy \nsolution, content delivery systems such as CDN and P2P were proposed and \nimplemented as overlays on the current IP network. These solutions are not \nwithout drawbacks resulting in inefficient dissemination and retrieval of \ncontents in the Internet.\n\nMotivated by this mismatch, a collection of future Internet architectures \nhas been proposed recently with the aim of re-engineering the current \nInternet towards supporting named-data communication. The approach \nemployed in the proposed architectures is generally known as Information \nCentric Networking (ICN) where content objects such as videos, documents \nand photos are uniquely named, enabling in-network storage of content for \ncaching, point-to-multipoint communication and interaction paradigms that \nseparate senders and receivers.\n\nContent-Centric Networking (CCN) is the most promising among the proposed \nICN architectures largely due to the significant attention it has drawn \nfrom networking researchers in the past few years. In the early years of \ntoday's Internet, a problem known as \"Congestion Collapse\" hit the \nInternet due to lack of congestion control in the widely used transport \nprotocol, TCP. Although CCN designers claim that CCN eliminates the \ndependency on end hosts performing congestion control and that CCN can \navoid such congestion collapse via in-network caching, practical scenarios \nhave emerged showing the possibility of congestion occurring in both \nInterest and Data paths. This has motivated several works on congestion \ncontrol in CCN.\n\nThese works implement congestion control at end hosts (receivers) and \nrouters, employing different strategies. Some of the proposals leverage \nsome features of CNN such as multipath forwarding and Interest lifetime. \nThis survey first provides background information on CCN and Internet \ncongestion control including explanation on why the currently used TCP \ncongestion control in the Internet is ill-suited for CCN.\n\nIt then presents the existing congestion control proposals in CCN towards \nidentifying their strengths and weaknesses.

The \nmost fundamental functionality, is to pinpoint the location of the target \nvia wireless devices. According to different application scenarios, we can \nclassify the existing indoor positioning techniques into two categories: \ndevice-based and device-free. In general, the applications requiring \nspecific devices on the entities to fulfill the localization function \nbelong to the device-based category. Otherwise, the ones whose subjects \ncarry no device pertain to device-free.\n\n\nWLAN has been witnessed to be a promising technique for indoor \nlocalization owing to its wide availability and prevalent infrastructure. \nMost WLAN-based positioning systems depend on received signal strength \n(RSS). However, RSS value is not reliable due to its coarse measurement \nand high temporal variability. ?In this paper, we first propose a new \nalternative called channel state information (CSI) which processes \nbeneficial properties for accurate localization, including: frequency \ndiversity and temporal stability. We then leverage CSI for device-based \npositioning and design two systems FILA and FIFS. FILA applies ranging \napproach to effectively compensate the multipath effects in complicated \nindoor environments. FIFS is a fingerprinting system that explores CSI to \nmanifest a unique location. Afterwards, we exploit the possibilities of \nemploying CSI for device-free application scenario, and design an indoor \nmotion detection system FIMD, which is an essential primitive for \nlocalization. We continue to further realize a device-free fingerprinting \nsystem Pilot based on the observation that CSI is capable of \ndistinguishing the environment variances when the object presents in \ndifferent positions. We conduct experiments in several typical indoor \nscenarios with commercial IEEE 802.11 NICs.

Such ever-growing demands of \nmobile data traffic drive the need to not greatly enhance the Wi-Fi based \nwireless communication capacity, but also to expand its service areas, \nmaking Wi-Fi pervasive. Meanwhile, this trend, on the other hand, provides \nthe basics to open another new era with Wi-Fi. Although Wi-Fi is \noriginally designed for communication, it is not limited to communication. \nBased on the pervasiveness of Wi-Fi, a series of pervasive applications \ncan be developed. In this proposal, we have conducted research on both of \nthese two aspects to advance the Wi-Fi technology, i.e., towards efficient \ncommunication and pervasive applications. Specifically, we have first \npropose two systems, hJam and CUTS, to improve the channel efficiency of \nwireless communication in the traditional point-to-point based and MU-MIMO \nbased WLANs respectively. hJam allows the data traffic and the control \nmessages to be transmitted simultaneously in the same channel while CUTS \nallows effective MU-MIMO in practice for uplink traffic by providing the \nantenna information of contention nodes in channel contention. Through our \nexperiments using USRP2s on a software radio testbed, we have shown these \nsystems can improve the channel efficiency of the existing systems \nsignificantly. Meanwhile, we have also proposed two pervasive applications \nby using Wi-Fi infrastructure, i.e., Wi-Fi based people counter and human \nidentification. Our preliminary results imply that they are feasible and \nhave the potential to be widely deployed. We have also presented our \nresearch plans on completing these two works\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 7 March 2014\n\nTime:\t\t\t4:00pm - 6:00pm\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 5501\n \t\t\tLifts 25-26\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung (Chairperson)\n \t\t\tProf. Lionel M Ni (Supervisor)\n\t\t\tProf. Bo Li\n                        Dr. Qiong Luo\n \t\t\t\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Advancing Wi-Fi Technology: Towards Efficient Communication and Pervasive Applications"], "lenArticle": 343},

In a seminal result, Myerson solved the single-item Bayesian \r\nmechanism design problem. Even though some progress was made in certain \r\nrestricted settings, the extension of this problem to multi-dimensional \r\nmechanism design, which may incorporate more general settings with \r\nmultiple heterogeneous items, asymmetric bidders' preferences as well as \r\ncomplicated feasibility constraints, remains open. Despite its importance \r\nin economics, this multi-dimensional mechanism design problem has been \r\nnotorious in algorithmic game theory due to the hardness of developing a \r\npolynomial-time optimal mechanism, even for simple cases.\r\n\r\nThis survey concentrates on describing progress on the optimal \r\nmulti-dimensional mechanism design problem. Our main purpose is to present \r\nan overview of the development of solutions for this problem, with \r\nemphasis on some recent typical ideas and techniques.

The large quantity of potential sensing data stimulates \r\nresearchers to probe into large-scale tasks that used to be costly or \r\nimpossible, such as noise pollution monitoring and traffic surveillance. Yet \r\nthe efficient aggregation of the crowdsourced data, which is of essential \r\nimportance for such sensing tasks, has not received sufficient attention. \r\nSpecifically, two main challenges of data aggregation are investigated in this \r\nproposal: how to motivate normal users to contribute sensing data and how to \r\nconduct robust inference from sensing data.\r\n\r\nThe low participation level of smartphone users due to various resource \r\nconsumptions, such as time and power, remains a hurdle that prevents the \r\nenjoyment brought by crowd sensing applications. Recently, some researchers \r\nhave done pioneer works in motivating users to contribute their resources by \r\ndesigning incentive mechanisms, which are able to provide certain rewards for \r\nparticipation. However, none of these works considered smartphone users' nature \r\nof opportunistically occurring in the area of interest. Specifically, for a \r\ngeneral smartphone sensing application, the platform would distribute tasks to \r\neach user on her arrival and has to make an immediate decision according to the \r\nuser's reply. To accommodate this general setting, we propose to design online \r\nincentive mechanisms based on online reverse auction.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the low-quality crowdsourced data are prone to containing \r\noutliers that may severely impair the mobile crowdsourcing applications. Thus \r\nin this proposal, we conduct pioneer investigation considering crowdsourced \r\ndata quality. Specifically, we focus on estimating user motion trajectory \r\ninformation, which plays an essential role in multiple crowdsourcing \r\napplications, such as indoor localization, context recognition, indoor \r\nnavigation, etc. We resort to the family of robust statistics and design a \r\nrobust trajectory estimation scheme, which is capable of alleviating the \r\nnegative influence of abnormal crowdsourced user trajectories, differentiating \r\nnormal users from abnormal users, and overcoming the challenge brought by \r\nspatial imbalance of crowdsourced trajectories.\r\n\r\nTheoretic properties of the designed methods are analyzed. Also, thorough \r\nsimulations and experiments are conducted to further verify the efficiency of \r\nthese methods in aggregating sensing data for mobile crowdsourcing.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 26 March 2014\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 4480\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Lei Chen (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Yunhao Liu (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Pan Hui\r\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Aggregating Sensing Data for Mobile Crowdsourcing"], "lenArticle": 413},

One major cause of such inefficiency is \r\nthat the passenger seats are under-utilized.

A \r\ndistributed file system provides a global name space and stores data \r\npersistently, but it also introduces significant overhead. Several recent \r\nsystems use DRAM to store data and tremendously improve the performance of \r\ncloud computing systems. However, both our own experience and related work \r\nindicate that a simple substitution of distributed DRAM for the file system \r\ndoes not provide a solid and viable foundation for data storage and processing \r\nin the datacenter environment, and the capacity of such systems is limited by \r\nthe amount of physical memory in the cluster.\r\n\r\nWe view the unified physical memory of many hosts as the solid data substrate \r\nfor large-scale efficient data processing for cloud-based systems. We \r\ninvestigate the limitation of the traditional file system-based system \r\nMapReduce using the parallel project compilation as a probing case with \r\nmoderate-size data with dependcences among numerous computational steps. We \r\npropose organizing the in-memory data processing in many compute nodes by \r\npresenting programmers a illusion of a big virtual machine, and design a new \r\ninstruction set architecture, i0, to unify myriads of compute nodes to form a \r\nbig virtual machine called MAchine ZEro (MAZE), and present programmers the \r\nview of a single computer where thousands of tasks run concurrently in a large, \r\nunified, and snapshotted memory space. i0 and MAZE form the foundation of the \r\nLayer Zero system which provides a generate substrate for cloud computing. The \r\nLayer Zero provides a simple yet scalable programming model and mitigates the \r\nscalability bottleneck of traditional distributed shared memory systems. Along \r\nwith an efficient execution engine, the capacity of a Layer Zero can scale up \r\nto support large clusters. We have implemented and tested Layer Zero on four \r\nplatforms, and our evaluation shows that Layer Zero has excellent performance \r\nand scalability. On the other hand, the simple substitution of distributed DRAM \r\nfor the file system does not fulfill the needs of many data storage and \r\nprocessing applications in the datacenter environment. The capacity of such \r\nsystems is limited by the amount of physical memory in the cluster and do not \r\nprovided data persistency mechanisms. We propose an improved data substrate to \r\nunify the physical memory and disk resources on many compute nodes, to form a \r\nsystem-wide data substrate for large-scale data processing. The substrate \r\nprovides a general memory-based abstraction, takes advantage of DRAM in the \r\nsystem to accelerate computation, and, transparent to programmers, scales the \r\nsystem to handle large datasets by swapping data to disks and remote servers. \r\nThe memory-based data substrate can also provide a solid foundation for data \r\nstorage systems such as key/value stores.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 9 April 2014\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Lin Gu (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Kai Chen (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\r\n \t\t\tProf. Qian Zhang\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Large-Scale In-Memory Data Processing"], "lenArticle": 522},

Naive \nmaximum-likelihood (ML) estimation of infrequent triphone models produces \npoor triphone models and eventually affects the overall performance of an \nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) system. Among different techniques \nproposed to solve the infrequent triphone problem, the most widely used \nmethod in current ASR systems is state tying because of its effectiveness \nin reducing model size and achieving good recognition results. However, \nstate tying inevitably introduces quantization errors since triphones tied \nto the same state are not distinguishable in that state. This thesis \naddresses the problem by the use of distinctacoustic modeling where every \nmodeling unit has a unique model and a distinct acoustic score.\n\nThe main contribution of this thesis is the formulation of the estimation \nof triphone models as an adaptation problem through our proposed distinct \nacoustic modeling framework named eigentriphone modeling. The rational \nbehind eigentriphone modeling is that a basis is derived over the frequent \ntriphones and then each triphone is modeled as a point in the space \nspanned by the basis. The eigenvectors in the basis represent the most \nimportant context-dependent characteristics among the triphones and thus \nthe infrequent triphones can be robustly modeled with few training \nsamples. Furthermore, the proposed framework is very flexible and can be \napplied to other modeling units. Since grapheme-based modeling is useful \nin automatic speech recognition of under-resourced languages, we further \napply our distinct acoustic modeling framework to estimate \ncontext-dependent grapheme models and we call our new method \neigentrigrapheme modeling. Experimental evaluation of eigentriphone \nmodeling was done on the Wall Street Journal word recognition task and the \nTIMIT phoneme recognition task. Experimental evaluation of \neigentrigrapheme modeling was done on four official South African \nunder-resourced languages. It is shown that distinct acoustic modeling \nconsistently performs better than the most common state tying method.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 11 April 2014\n\nTime:\t\t\t10:00am \u2013 12:00noon\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 5505\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Yongsheng Gao (MAE)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Brian Mak (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Siu-Wing Cheng\n \t\t\tProf. Raymond Wong\n \t\t\tProf. Wing-Hung Ki (ECE)\n                        Prof. Tan Lee (Elec.

For \nexample, GPS navigation systems maintain and query road networks to guide \ncar-drivers to their destinations; while rescue centers maintain the \nterrain information for the purpose of disaster response.\n\nCompared with Euclidean space, spatial networks are usually a more \nrealistic setting for many real world database applications, and thus, it \nis very important to support efficient query processing over spatial \nnetworks. Many spatial queries that were first studied in the Euclidean \nspace have been studied over spatial networks, including nearest neighbor \n(NN) queries, reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) queries, aggregate nearest \nneighbor (ANN) queries, skyline queries, facility location problem, etc.\n\nThe scope of this thesis goes beyond those traditional spatial queries, \nand we propose to study novel spatial queries that are of special interest \nto applications related to spatial networks. This first kind of query is \nOptimal Meeting Point (OMP) query that finds the location p that minimizes \na cost function defined over the distances from p to all the query points. \nApplications of OMP queries include determining the location of a \nconference venue, and deciding the pick-up location of a tourist bus. The \nsecond kind of query is Distance-Preserving Subgraph (DPS) query which \nfinds a subgraph of the spatial network that preserves the shortest path \nbetween any two query points. DPS queries are important in route \nrecommendation systems, logistics planning, and all kinds of \nshortest-path-related applications that run on resource-limited mobile \ndevices. We then study Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) that models \nterrain data. Specifically, we study monochromatic and bichromatic reverse \nnearest neighbor queries over terrain data. We show that evaluating such \ntraditional spatial queries over terrain data conforming to TIN model is \nvery challenging, and introducing techniques for efficient query \nprocessing over terrain.\n\nWe also consider distributed processing of large spatial networks. \nSpecifically, we review the Pregel graph computing framework proposed by \nGoogle, and show how to process spatial queries in Pregel. We then \nindicate the weaknesses of Pregel in processing large-diameter spatial \nnetworks, and discuss how to improve Pregel s framework for more efficient \nquery processing over spatial networks.\n\nFinally, we discuss about possible future work over spatial networks.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 2 May 2014\n\nTime:\t\t\t11:00am \u2013 1:00pm\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Tai-Yuan Chen (ACCT)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Wilfred Ng (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Frederick Lochovsky\n \t\t\tProf. Dimitris Papadias\n \t\t\tProf. Xiangtong Qi (IELM)\n                        Prof. Qing Li (Comp.

Collision happens when two or \r\nmore data packets overlap in the time domain at receiver and none of them \r\ncan be received correctly. Collision increases packet delivery delay, \r\ndecreases network throughput and incurs extra energy cost because of \r\nretransmissions. To tackle collision, researchers propose abundant \r\nprotocols in Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. The essential idea behind \r\nthese protocols is to properly coordinate multiple senders to access a \r\nshared channel and avoid the case where there are two or more senders \r\naccessing a shared channel simultaneously. While in recent years, an \r\nincreasing number of protocols are invented to approach collision in the \r\nphysical layer (PHY). PHY layer demonstrates promising properties, e.g., \r\npower indicator like RSSI, the effect of capture and constructive \r\ninterference, which enable us resolve collision from its nature as \r\nwireless signals.\r\n\r\nThis proposal first draws a new logical roadmap along which we understand \r\nand deal with collision. The roadmap is: collision avoidance -> collision \r\ntolerance -> collision cancellation -> collision exploitation. We in the \r\nbeginning avoid collision out of its harm, and then we can just tolerate \r\nthem with some \u201cpowerful weapons\u201d. After that, we try to cancel collision \r\nwith more powerful techniques and finally we realize that collision could \r\nbe utilized to assists us. Guided by this roadmap, the proposal mainly \r\naddresses collision to achieve energy-efficient scheduling and \r\nnear-optimal channel utilization, respectively in the stages of collision \r\navoidance and tolerance. For the former, we find an interesting stair-like \r\npattern of RSSI constructed by colliding signals under constructive \r\ninterference. By intentionally forming this stair pattern, receiver is \r\nable to distinguish colliding senders and further distinguish and schedule \r\nthem in only one round. For the latter, we change the channel access \r\nmethod from an asynchronous way to a synchronous one based on the capture \r\neffect in PHY layer. With multiple users accessing a shared channel \r\nsimultaneously yet guaranteeing with high probability that one of them can \r\ntransmit successfully, the channel utilization can be improved and \r\napproximates its optimal value.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 12 May 2014\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 4475\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Yunhao Liu (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Pan Hui (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Gary Chan\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Understanding and Resolving Wireless Collision with PHY Techniques"], "lenArticle": 402},

It is widely used in a \nvariety of applications such as warehouse management, inventory control, \nobject tracking and localization, etc. RFID devices, especially tags, have \nsmall size and ultra-low power consumption. With such advantages, they are \nwell-suited to automatic inventory management in a large-scale. In \npractice, large-scale management in RFID systems is primarily comprised of \ntwo mainstreams, namely tag identification and estimation. Identification \nis a basic operation of collecting tag IDs to identify corresponding \nobjects. Estimation aims to count the number of tags quickly and \naccurately.\n\nIn this dissertation, we explore how to design effective protocols to \nbuild large-scale RFID management systems. The protocols, as introduced \nabove, address two fundamental problems in RFID systems, namely \nidentification and estimation. Both types of protocols should scale well \nto massive tags.\n\nIn our first work, we investigate how to efficiently identify a large \namount of tags with one mobile reader that continuous changes its position \nto expand the coverage, denoted as the continuous scanning problem. We \nobserve that the performance of continuous scanning protocol depends on \nthe spatial distribution of tags in two adjacent scans. An adaptive \ncontinuous scanning protocol is proposed that selects the best scanning \nstrategy according to the current spatial distribution of tags.\n\nIn our second work, we study the conventional RFID estimation problem. We \nnotice that existing estimation approaches merely provide asymptotic \nresults of estimation time, but fail to give tight bounds for the \nconvergence rate of corresponding algorithms. We propose an estimation \nscheme that achieves Arbitrarily Accurate Approximation (A3) for the tag \npopulation size. More importantly, we give a rigorous bound O((loglog \nn+\u03b5-2)+log\u03c3-1) in its communication time, for a given (\u03b5,\u03c3) accuracy \nrequirement.\n\nIn our last work, we explore a generalized RFID estimation problem named \nGeneric Composite Counting. The conventional RFID estimation problem \nfocuses on counting the number of tags in a single tag set, or at most the \nunion of multiple tag sets. This simple scenario is far from enough to \nmeet various application demands. To address this problem, we introduce a \nmore complex counting model, which aims to estimate the cardinality of a \ncomposite set expression such as S1\u222aS2-S3 where Si (1\u2264i\u22643) denotes a \ntag set. A Composite Counting Framework (CCF) is designed to provide \nestimates for any set expression with desired (\u03b5,\u03c3) accuracy.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 13 May 2014\n\nTime:                   10:00am - 12:00noon\n\nVenue:                  Room 3501\n                        lifts 25/26\n\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Lei Chen (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tDr. Yunhao Liu (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi (Chairperson)\n \t\t\tProf. Gary Chan\n \t\t\tDr. Lin Gu\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Towards Efficient Large-Scale RFID Management"], "lenArticle": 449},

Among \r\nthem, jamming, which involves purposefully trying to interfere with the \r\ntransmission and reception, is one of the major forms of attacks that can \r\neasily be staged in wireless local area networks (WLANs).\r\n\r\nIn this thesis we propose a new jamming attack on hidden nodes in WLANs. \r\nThis attack deliberately targets uplink TCP acknowledgement packets \r\n(TCP-ACKs) of some downlink TCP flow as a means of increasing the \r\nthroughput of the attacker(s). The jamming attack is designed in such a \r\nway that no modification to the wireless hardware is needed and it can be \r\neasily staged on commercial off-the-shelf wireless nodes. The attack \r\nconsists of a series of well-coordinated stealth attacks on TCP traffic \r\nwith the collective effect of degrading the target's throughput by causing \r\noccasional time-outs and by increasing its round-trip times (RTTs). In \r\nthis attack, a rogue node first scans the channel for downlink traffic \r\n(from the AP), identifies one or several target nodes, then relies on our \r\nprobabilistic estimation model to forecast the time when a transmission of \r\njamming signal has a high likelihood of colliding with the target's \r\ngenerated TCP-ACKs. Repeating this process intelligently results in a \r\ndecrease of the average window of the targeted TCP sender and an increase \r\nin its round-trip time, in addition to some occasional time-outs due to \r\nconsecutive TCP-ACK losses. The rogue node and/or its colluding attackers \r\ncan thus increase their TCP throughput. We conduct ns-2 protocol \r\nsimulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of such attack and discuss \r\nits immunity to detection by existing detection schemes. We also identify \r\nsome possible parameters that may be used in building future detection \r\nmechanisms to counter this attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 13 May 2014\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Brahim Bensaou (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Kai Chen\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["On Jamming in Wireless Local Area Networks"], "lenArticle": 340},

Over the last decade, the widespread adoption of Wireless Local Area \r\nNetworks (WLAN) has triggered the proliferation of mobile devices, \r\nresulting in a dramatic growth in the amount of the mobile data traffic. \r\nTo complement this growth in demand, there has been a steadily advancement \r\nof the data rate in recent years. However, the high theoretical data rate \r\noften sustains a low actual throughput in the real world transmissions, \r\nreferred as a low efficiency problem in wireless communication. Therefore, \r\nit is essential to achieve efficient communication in the wireless design.\r\n\r\nIn traditional WLANs with point-to-point communication, the low efficiency \r\nproblem is mainly induced by the coordination overhead. To avoid radio \r\ninterference and packet collisions, coordination is required to allow \r\nmultiple access in the multi-station WLANs. But the existing coordination \r\nschemes themselves account for too much of the transmission air time by \r\nexchanging control messages, resulting in a significant control overhead. \r\nThis motivates us to provide a cost-effective coordination scheme in the \r\nwireless transmission. To achieve this, we propose a cross layer design, \r\nnamed hJam, for OFDM-based WLANs. Rather than interleaving or separating \r\nthe control messages and data traffic as the traditional communication \r\nparadigms, hJam serves them together at the same time. By exploiting the \r\nredundancy in the preamble, the control messages are able to be \r\ntransmitted in an attached manner with the data traffic. Therefore, hJam \r\neliminates the control overhead by enabling the concurrent transmission of \r\ncoordination message and traffic data to improve the coordination \r\nefficiency. Through extensive experiments, we have demonstrated the \r\nsignificant improvement of channel efficiency based on the design of hJam.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the emerging Multi-user Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output \r\n(MU-MIMO) has also attracted attention in wireless communication by \r\nallowing the concurrent transmissions among multiple transmitters to the \r\nsame receiver. The traditional approaches only focus on the efficiency in \r\nthe time domain by reducing the control overhead. Differently, the channel \r\nefficiency problem becomes even more challenging in MU-MIMO networks by \r\nintroducing an extra dimension, i.e., spatial domain, for the concurrent \r\ntransmission for multiple nodes. Through analysis, we investigate that it \r\nis crucial to utilize the antenna usage by ensuring as many as possible \r\nsimultaneous streams sent to the AP in MU-MIMO networks. Therefore, \r\nchannel utilization in MU-MIMO networks should consider both the time and \r\nspatial domain, i.e., the efficient channel time and antenna usage at AP. \r\nTo achieve this, we propose a new MAC-PHY design, named CUTS, by using \r\ninterference nulling for attaching the antenna information in frequency \r\ndomain channel contention, combined with the technique ACK in the \r\nfrequency domain using self-jamming. We have validated and prove the \r\neffectiveness on channel efficiency by using the CUTS design through \r\nextensive experiments.

The \r\nmost fundamental functionality, is to pinpoint the location of the target \r\nvia wireless devices. According to different application scenarios, we can \r\nclassify the existing indoor positioning techniques into two categories: \r\ndevice-based and device-free. In general, the applications that requiring \r\nspecific devices on the entities to fulfill the localization function \r\nbelong to the device-based category. Otherwise, the ones whose subjects \r\ncarry no device pertain to device-free.\r\n\r\nWLAN has been witnessed to be a promising technique for indoor \r\nlocalization owing to its wide availability and prevalent infrastructure. \r\nMost WLAN-based positioning systems depend on received signal strength \r\n(RSS). However, RSS value is not reliable due to its coarse measurement \r\nand high temporal variability. In this paper, we first propose a new \r\nalternative called channel state information (CSI) which processes \r\nbeneficial properties for accurate localization, including: frequency \r\ndiversity and temporal stability. We then leverage CSI for device-based \r\npositioning and design three systems FILA, FIFS and NomLoc. FILA applies \r\nranging approach to effectively compensate the multipath effects in \r\ncomplicated indoor environments. FIFS is a fingerprinting system that \r\nexplores CSI to manifest a unique location. The NomLoc system leverages \r\nthe mobility of nomadic APs and fine-grained CSI to dynamically adjust the \r\nWLAN network topology without calibration efforts. Afterwards, we exploit \r\nthe possibilities of employing CSI for device-free application scenarios, \r\nand design an indoor motion detection system FIMD, which is an essential \r\nprimitive for localization. We continue to further realize a device-free \r\nfingerprinting system Pilot based on the observation that CSI is capable \r\nof distinguishing the environment variances when the object presents in \r\ndifferent positions. We conduct experiments in several typical indoor \r\nscenarios with commercial IEEE 802.11 NICs.

For quadTreeMatch, the space is regularly subdivided into \r\n4 children until each bucket contains no more than B points, where B is the \r\nbucket capacity. With either index on the reference table, we match the stars \r\nin the sample table through parallel index probes on the reference. We \r\nimplemented these algorithms on a multicore CPU as well as a desktop GPU, and \r\nevaluated their performance on both synthetic data and real-world astronomical \r\ndata.

We focus on two scenarios; (i) when the \r\nstatistics are computed over a static database, and (ii) when the statistics \r\nare published continuously over data that are updated by a stream.\r\n\r\nFor the first scenario, we address one-time publishing of non-overlapping \r\ncounts. These statistics are useful in a wide and important range of \r\napplications, including transactional, traffic and medical data analysis. Prior \r\nwork on epsilon-differential privacy publishes such statistics with \r\nprohibitively low utility in several practical scenarios. Towards this end, we \r\npresent GS, a method that pre-processes the counts by elaborately grouping and \r\nsmoothing them via averaging. This step acts as a form of preliminary \r\nperturbation that diminishes sensitivity, and enables GS to achieve \r\nepsilon-differential privacy through low Laplace noise injection. The grouping \r\nstrategy is dictated by a sampling mechanism, which minimizes the smoothing \r\nperturbation. We demonstrate the superiority of GS over its competitors, and \r\nconfirm its practicality, via extensive experiments on real datasets.\r\n\r\nFor the second scenario, we address continuously publishing of non-overlapping \r\ncounts. Numerous applications require continuous publication of statistics for \r\nmonitoring purposes, such as real-time traffic analysis, timely disease \r\noutbreak discovery, and social trends observation. These statistics may be \r\nderived from sensitive user data and, hence, necessitate privacy preservation. \r\nAlthough epsilon-differential privacy is a notable paradigm for offering strong \r\nprivacy guarantees in statistics publishing, there is limited literature that \r\nadapts this concept to settings where the statistics are computed over an \r\ninfinite stream of \"events\" (i.e., data items generated by the users), and \r\npublished periodically. These works aim at hiding a single event over the \r\nentire stream. We argue that, in most practical scenarios, sensitive \r\ninformation is revealed from multiple events occurring at contiguous time \r\ninstances. Towards this end, we put forth the novel notion of w-event privacy \r\nover infinite streams, which protects an event sequence occurring in w \r\nsuccessive time instants. We first formulate our privacy concept, motivate its \r\nimportance, and introduce a methodology for achieving it. We next design two \r\ninstantiations, whose utility is independent of the stream length. Finally, we \r\nconfirm the practicality of our solutions experimenting with real data.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 29 May 2014\r\n\r\nTime:                   1:00pm - 3:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dimitris Papadias (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dik-Lun Lee\r\n \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Practical Differential Privacy"], "lenArticle": 409},

Thanks to the easiness of publishing and \r\nspreading information on these platforms, users can report instant news or \r\nemergencies and others can follow up or help spread the related messages. \r\nPeople can learn about certain events even more instantly on these \r\nplatforms than on traditional news media platforms. However, due to the \r\nhuge number of messages generated every second in these social networks, \r\nmanually monitoring any instant event is costly and infeasible. \r\nResearchers have been exploring automatic event detection solutions for \r\nthese platforms.\r\n\r\nAutomatic event detection in social networks is however non-trivial and \r\nchallenging.

Travel \r\ncost on road segments is the important hidden knowledge in the metropolitan \r\ncity, which can be leveraged by travel route planning, traffic event discovery, \r\nand city\u2019s fraud detection, etc. This paper addresses the problem of travel \r\ncost estimation and prediction on road network with a not only innovative but \r\nalso practical solution. Although some previous work deal with the same topic, \r\nthey estimate travel cost on road segments based on the spatial and temporal \r\nsmoothness of adjacent neighbors, which is unreasonable under some \r\ncircumstances. Other works predicting travel cost ignore the obstacle of data \r\nsparsity by not predicting the travel cost of road segments without traffic \r\ndata. In viewing this defect, we proposed the methodology to estimate and \r\npredict travel cost based on objects similarity. To be more specifically, we \r\ndefine the spatial temporal dividing sample as the minimal unit whose travel \r\ncost is to be estimated or predicted. Knowledgeable samples present those who \r\nhave traffic data points, and their travel cost can be estimated by the traffic \r\ndata. While unknowledgeable samples are those who encounter the problem of data \r\nsparsity, and have no estimation of travel cost since the lack of traffic data \r\npoints. By extracting both the static and dynamic features for those samples, \r\nwe profile them and apply the clustering algorithm on them to identify similar \r\nsamples. Within each cluster, we leverage the artificial neural network to \r\nbuild the mapping relationship between knowledgeable samples features and their \r\ntravel cost. With the help of this mapping relationship, we finally infer the \r\nclusters unknowledgeable samples travel cost. In terms of travel cost \r\nprediction, based on the intuition that similar road segments share similar \r\ntravel cost pattern, we put all the road segments into different clusters and \r\nshare the observed traffic data in the same cluster to overcome the obstacle of \r\ndata sparsity. And finally we leverage the time series predicting model to \r\npredict the travel cost in the future. We evaluate our methodology on one-month \r\nreal traffic data from Shanghai.

To make context sensitive points-to analysis practical to routine \r\nusages, we implement an efficient points-to engine GeomPTA, based on a novel \r\ntechnique, geometric encoding, to effectively capture the redundancy in \r\nrepresenting a large number of contexts. Geometric encoding is capable of \r\nevaluating contexts of points-to constraints in the compressed form, but \r\nincurring much less space and time requirements compared to other compressing \r\ntechniques such as BDD.\u00a0GeomPTA\u00a0can analyze large Java\u00a0programs with JDK 1.6 \r\nlibrary 7.1X -- 81.9X faster than the worklist based 1-object-sensitive \r\nanalysis in Paddle, and meanwhile its precision is comparable or better than \r\n1-object-sensitive analysis.

Therefore, we develop a technique, Pestrie, to \r\ncompress and persist the points-to and aliasing information, making pointer \r\ninformation easily reusable. Also, the compressed information is structured for \r\nfast querying. Empirically, Pestrie is 2.9X -- 123.6X faster than the \r\ndemand-driven approaches based on points-to information.

My objective is to \nbuild a more efficient underlying networks and improve the performance of such \ncomputing system.

The idea is motivated by the key observations that rich \ntraffic demand information already exists in the log and meta-data files of \nmany big data applications, and that such information can be readily extracted \nthrough run-time file system monitoring. As an initial step, we use Hadoop as a \nconcrete example to explore our methodology and develop a system called \nHadoopWatch to predict traffic demand of Hadoop applications. Our experiments \nover a series of MapReduce applications demonstrate that HadoopWatch can \nforecast the traffic demand with almost 100% accuracy and time advance. \nMeanwhile, it makes no modification of the Hadoop framework, and introduces \nlittle overhead to the application performance.\n\nSecond, I also make my attempt to orchestrate the network with the traffic \ndemand information forecasted by HadoopWatch.

Leveraging the scale of \neconomy, data centers are much more cost-efficient than traditional enterprise \nnetworks. The ambulant redundancy of both computation servers and network \ndevices guarantee the reliability of data centers. The symmetric network \ntypologies in most data centers further provide many candidate paths to ensure \nnetwork connectivity. In addition, data centers usually adopt uniform \nmanagement strategies across the network, which can elastically control the \nnetwork and improve the security of stored data.\n\nTasks in a data center, such as web search queries or MapReduce jobs, usually \nconsist of plenty of flows transferring data among different virtual machines \nacross the network. The completion time of these flows significantly influence \nthe user perceived performance and network efficiency. In this paper, we \ninvestigate the state-of-art flow scheduling schemes in data center networks. \nBefore the introduction of task-awareness, both academic research and industry \nstandard have focused on reducing the completion time of each individual flow, \naiming to minimize the average completion time of all the flows in a network. \nThis is equivalent to maximizing the overall throughput of a network. \nNevertheless, different flows within the same task are correlated with one \nanother, in the sense that a task is not considered to be completed till the \ncompletion of all its constituent flows. Therefore, the task completion time is \nfar more relevant than the completion time of any individual flow within. We \nneed to coordinate and schedule the flows with the task semantics into \nconsideration.\n\nTask-aware scheduling is a novel concept, and there exists many challenges and \nopen problems to solve. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate existing \nliterature regarding flow scheduling in data center networks.

In most cases, a simple model learned from data is at a \r\nmore favorable side than complicated ones, since it can often provide better \r\ngeneralization performance, together with intuitive interpretation.\r\n\r\nBeside pure sparsity induced by l1-norm, sophisticated \r\nstructured-sparsity-inducing regularizers are highly desirable when the \r\nfeatures have some intrinsic structures. In this proposal, we address three \r\naspects of sparse modeling:\r\n\r\n1. Hierarchy feature selection: Hierarchical and structural relationships among \r\nfeatures are often used to constrain the search for the more important \r\ninteractions.  We propose the use of the alternating direction method of \r\nmultipliers (ADMM) and accelerated gradient methods. In particular, we show \r\nthat ADMM can be used to either directly solve the problem or serve as a key \r\nbuilding block.\r\n\r\n2. Automatic cluster discovery: Traditional multitask learning (MTL) are \r\nlimited to modeling these relationships at the task level, which may be \r\nrestrictive in some applications. We propose a novel MTL formulation that \r\ncaptures task relationships at the feature-level. Depending on the interactions \r\namong tasks and features, the proposed method construct different task clusters \r\nfor different features. Computationally, the proposed formulation is convex, \r\nand can be efficiently solved by accelerated gradient methods.\r\n\r\n3. Nonconvex regularization:  Nonconvex regularizers can outperform their \r\nconvex counterparts in many situations. However, the resulting nonconvex \r\noptimization problems are often challenging. By using a recent mathematical \r\ntool known as the proximal average, we propose a novel proximal gradient \r\ndescent method for optimization with a wide class of nonconvex and composite \r\nregularizers.

Compared with the data collected from experiments, \r\nthe log data can more accurately reflect the user behavior with little bias. \r\nThese data provide an opportunity to understand user behavior and help improve \r\nuser experience. For example, by analyzing how users use search engines and why \r\nthey are not satisfied with the search result, we can improve the usability of \r\nsearch engines, such as search personalization and search accuracy. However, \r\nanalyzing the log data is challenging. For instance, exploring the raw data is \r\nan essential step to formulate hypotheses and build models, but the log data \r\nsize is large and increases over time. Visual analytic methods, in the case, \r\ncan greatly help explore and analyze the data, because using visualization \r\ncomponents enables to express a large amount of information in a very efficient \r\nand intuitive way, since human perceptual system can process visual information \r\nrapidly, and it can help start analysis without assumptions.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we focus on two types of log data. The first one is the search \r\nlog data, which record how users use different search engines to perform \r\nqueries and is collected from a world wide distributed web browser. The second \r\none is the learning log data from a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) \r\nplatform. In order to better understand the actual needs when analyzing the log \r\ndata, we conducted several rounds of interviews with domain experts who are the \r\nend users of visual analytics systems. After that, we follow the user centered \r\ndesign and iteratively design three analytics systems. In the first system, \r\nRankExplorer, we present a new visualization technique to intuitively show the \r\nranking changes of queries in search log data. In the second system, \r\nLoyalTracker, we target on better understanding user loyalty and defection \r\nbehavior in search log data. In the third system, VisMOOC, we focus on \r\nanalyzing learning behavior through learning log data. All the three systems \r\ngive domain experts new insights into user behavior.

Nowadays, both scientific \nand industrial communities are encouraged to collect as much trajectory data as \npossible, which brings many opportunities and problems, including: 1) the raw \ndata collected by the GPS device requires reorganization and preprocessing to \nenable further analysis; 2) it is expensive and challenging to store and \nprocess such big trajectory data efficiently; and 3) by leveraging effective \nspatial-temporal queries from the trajectory data, it enables us to discover \nvarious knowledge that are difficult to identify intuitively. In this thesis, \nwe propose a complete system from the preprocessing of raw trajectory data, to \nthe storage and query processing of the trajectories, and finally the discovery \nof the hidden knowledge from such data. For each component of the system, we \nstudy and solve a specific problem regarding to the component, as: 1) inferring \nthe road type in crowdsourced map services; 2) exploring the use of diverse \nreplicas for big location tracking data; and 3) recommending trajectories for \neffective and efficient hunting of taxi passengers.\n\nFor the road type inference problem, we propose a combined model based on \nstacked generalization to infer the types of road segments, and conduct eight \nexperiments based on different classifiers to show that our method is much \nbetter than the baseline methods. For the use of diverse replicas for big \ntrajectory data, we propose BLOT, a system abstraction which tries to find the \noptimal set of diverse replicas that suitable for the costs of a set of \ntrajectory queries.

For the taxi hunting route recommendation \nproblem, we introduce the HUNTS system based on the estimations of the benefits \nof road segments, and make reasonable hunting trajectory recommendations for \ntaxi drivers to make more money.\n\nDue to the low-density, sparsity, and uncertainty of trajectories, handling \nsuch data may face many challenges.

The risk of spectrum crutch, where \nthe user demand outstrips the available spectrum, motivates the research on \ndynamic spectrum access to improve the usage of the under-utilized spectrums. \nIn this thesis proposal, we study the spectrum management for dynamic spectrum \naccess networks from three aspects: spectrum auction, spectrum allocation \nbetween li- censed and unlicensed use, and hybrid access in femtocell networks. \nWe identify the challenges under each scenario, and propose solutions to \naddress the problem.\n\nFor the spectrum auction, we have two proposals. First, we design a double \nauction mechanism for heterogeneous spectrums, dealing with the problem of \nheterogeneous interference graphs and heterogeneous buyers valuations. Second, \nwe design an online double auction mechanism for dy- namic spectrum access, \ntaking into consideration the location-determined interference relationship \namong buyers. For the spectrum allocation between licensed and unlicensed use, \nwe build a three- stage game model to characterize the interaction among the \nspectrum regulator, the licensed and the unlicensed operators, and the end \nusers. The target is a balance of allocation income for the spectrum regulator \nand social welfare for the end users. For the hybrid access in femtocell \nnetwork- s, we also have two proposals. First, we establish a utility-aware \nrefunding framework, in which the macrocell operator refunds the femtocell \nowners for sharing their femtocell resources.

The telecommunication \r\nindustry and international standardization bodies have placed considerable \r\nattention to the deployment of extremely dense networks, referred to as \r\nDenseNets, which creates a bundle of opportunities for high spatial reuse and \r\nenergy efficiency by reducing the distance between Access Points (APs) and \r\nclients. Industrial practices of DenseNets include small-scale femtocells in \r\nLTE/LTE-A based cellular systems and WiFi hotspots in public places in IEEE \r\n802.11 based High Efficiency WLAN (HEW). Both empirical experiences and \r\ntheoretical analyses suggest that DenseNets will encompass significant \r\ntechnical challenges related to reliable and efficient access and management. \r\nOn the one hand, DenseNets contain a significant number of densely-deployed APs \r\nwith highly overlapped regions, making network maintenance a complicated and \r\nchallenging task. On the other hand, there are normally a crowd of clients in \r\nDenseNets, and thus efficient access control is expected to meet the high \r\nper-user-throughput demands with a limited amount of bandwidth.\r\n\r\nWe have two proposals for DenseNets, where each aims to address one challenge \r\nas mentioned above. First, we propose a automatic fault management framework \r\nfor dense femtocell networks. Under this framework, we propose three system \r\ndesigns for outage detection, fault diagnosis, and self-healing functions. As \r\nthe first step of our automatic management framework, the proposed outage \r\ndetection design exploits signal correlations among multiple femtocells to \r\nimprove detection accuracy for small-size densely-deployed femtocell networks. \r\nThe outage detection system triggers fault diagnostic system. In our diagnostic \r\nsystem design, we develop a transfer learning based approach to overcome the \r\ndata scarcity issue in small-size femtocells. After identifying the specific \r\nfault, outage is compensated by a self-healing scheme. We study the \r\ninterference outage case, and propose a local cooperative grouping architecture \r\nto iteratively recover the network outage. Second, we propose an efficient \r\naccess framework for WiFi networks with large audience environments. We analyze \r\nthe poor performance of WiFi for large audience environments, and propose a \r\nPHY/MAC design to improve efficiency in public WLANs. The proposed design \r\naggregates multi-user's transmissions into one transmission so as to reduce \r\ncontention overhead. The above studies demonstrate that with appropriate system \r\ndesigns, reliable and efficient DenseNets can be achieved to meet high data \r\nrate and ubiquitous connection demands.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 13 June 2014\r\n\r\nTime:                   4:00pm - 6:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Qian Zhang (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Bo Li (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lin Gu\r\n \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Efficient and Reliable Design for Extremely Dense Wireless Networks"], "lenArticle": 443},

Currently, there is no well-recognized objective and effective means \nto profile app developers. As the mobile market grows, it already gives rise to \nthe problem of finding appropriate apps from the users' point of view. In this \nthesis, we propose a framework called App Developer Inspector (ADI), which aims \nto effectively profile app developers in aspects of their expertise and \nreputation in developing apps. ADI is essentially founded on two underlying \nmodels: the App Developer Expertise (ADE) model and the App Developer \nReputation (ADR) model. In a nutshell, ADE is a generative model that derives \nthe latent expertise for each developer and ADR is a model that exploits \nmultiple features to evaluate app developers' reputation. Using the app \ndeveloper profiles generated in ADI, we study two new applications which \nrespectively facilitate app search and app development outsourcing.

DSE generates next inputs by selecting branches from \r\nprevious execution paths, but a large number of candidate branches makes a \r\nsimple exhaustive search infeasible, which often leads to poor test \r\ncoverage. Several search strategies have been proposed to explore \r\nhigh-priority branches only. Each strategy applies different criteria to \r\nthe branch selection process but most do not consider context, how we got \r\nto the branch, in the selection process. In this work, we introduce a \r\ncontext-guided search (CGS) strategy. CGS looks at preceding branches in \r\nexecution paths and selects a branch in a new context for the next input. \r\nWe evaluate CGS with two publicly available concolic testing tools, CREST \r\nand CarFast, on six C subjects and six Java subjects. The experimental \r\nresults show that CGS achieves the highest coverage of all twelve subjects \r\nand reaches target coverage with a much smaller number of iterations on \r\nmost subjects than other strategies. This work has been accepted in FSE \r\n2014.\r\n\r\nAlthough CSG achieves higher coverage with a smaller number of inputs, it \r\nmay still suffer from UNSAT results from the SMT solvers. A branch \r\nselected by a strategy may only be covered from specific execution paths \r\nonly but search strategies do not know this information and may result in \r\ncontinuously selecting a branch until it is covered wasting a large \r\nportion of testing budget. To address this problem, we propose a technique \r\ncombining static analysis results based on abstract interpretation with \r\nDSE. Abstract interpretation is a theory of sound approximation of the \r\nsemantics of computer programs. We define domains for the possible values \r\nof variables in a program and run a pre-analysis and exploit this \r\ninformation in the branch selection process. This technique can be \r\ncombined with search strategies to improve coverage in general or to guide \r\nthe execution toward specific code area to test recently changed code such \r\nas software patches.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 3 July 2014\r\n\r\nTime:                   9:30am - 11:30am\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Sunghun Kim (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Charles Zhang (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Search Strategies in Dynamic Symbolic Execution"], "lenArticle": 385},

Furthermore, high-resolution, free-viewpoint and \nmultiview videos have brought new market opportunities.

In this \nthesis, we study the optimization of overlay network so as to \ncost-effectively support such next-generation video services.

We propose an efficient push-based multi-tree algorithm to \nachieve a low-delay high-bandwidth overlay backbone.

The large quantity of potential sensing data stimulates \nresearchers to probe into large-scale tasks that used to be costly or \nimpossible, such as noise pollution monitoring and traffic surveillance. Yet \nthe efficient aggregation of the crowdsourced data, which is of essential \nimportance for such sensing tasks, has not received sufficient attention. \nSpecifically, we investigate the following crucial challenges of data \naggregation in this thesis:  how to motivate normal users to contribute sensing \ndata and how to conduct robust inference from sensing data.\n\nThe low participation level of smartphone users due to various resource \nconsumptions, such as time and power, remains a hurdle that prevents the \nenjoyment brought by crowd sensing applications. Recently, some researchers \nhave done pioneer works in motivating users to contribute their resources by \ndesigning incentive mechanisms, which are able to provide certain rewards for \nparticipation. However, none of these works considered smartphone users nature \nof opportunistically occurring in the area of interest.  Specifically, for a \ngeneral smartphone sensing application, the platform would distribute tasks to \neach user on her arrival and has to make an immediate decision according to the \nuser's reply.  To accommodate this general setting, we propose to design online \nincentive mechanisms based on online reverse auction.\n\nOn the other hand, the low-quality crowdsourced data are prone to containing \noutliers that may severely impair the mobile crowdsourcing applications. Thus \nin this thesis, we conduct pioneer investigation considering crowdsourced data \nquality. Specifically, we focus on estimating user motion trajectory \ninformation, which plays an essential role in multiple crowdsourcing \napplications, such as indoor localization, context recognition, indoor \nnavigation, etc.  We resort to the family of robust statistics and design a \nrobust trajectory estimation scheme, which is capable of alleviating the \nnegative influence of abnormal crowdsourced user trajectories, differentiating \nnormal users from abnormal users, and overcoming the challenge brought by \nspatial imbalance of crowdsourced trajectories.\n\nMost of mobile sensing applications rely on inference components heavily for \ndetecting interesting activities or contexts.  Existing work implements \ninference components using traditional models designed for balanced data sets, \nwhere the sizes of interesting (positive) and non-interesting (negative) data \nare comparable. Practically, however, the positive and negative sensing data \nare highly imbalanced. Therefore, we propose a new inference framework SLIM \nbased on several machine learning techniques in order to accommodate the \nimbalanced nature of sensing data.\n\nTheoretic properties of the designed methods are analyzed.

And these graphs are often dynamically \nchanging. One example is the bibliographic database, where authors and research \ntopics are different types of entities, and the graph changes over time as the \nresearchers switch their interests or form new collaborative relations. \nResearch in the area of graph visualization has been concerned with designing \nnovel and effective visual encoding schemes and user interactions for the \nviewers to gain insight into graph data. We follow this line of research and \nthis proposal reports our work in developing visual analysis techniques for \nheterogeneous and dynamic graph data from various application domains.\n\nIn the first work, we visualize heterogeneous graph data that not only records \nthe relationship among people, but also the various items they are related to \n(e.g. interested topics or music). We design visualizations that can help to \nstudy if people closely linked have similar items of interest, and introduce a \nnovel set visualization technique and the corresponding layout algorithm to \ndisplay the overlap of their interests. The techniques are applied to a \nbibliographic dataset and the user data from a social music service website.\n\nThe second work studies the dynamic interplay among topics, opinion leaders and \nthe audiences on social media. More specifically, we propose a combination of \ntime series modeling and interactive visualization techniques to study how \nvarious topics compete to attract public attention when they are spreading on \nsocial media (e.g. Twitter), and what roles do opinion leaders such as mass \nmedia, political figures and grassroots play in the rise and fall of various \ntopics.

Specifically, whenever a human serves to compute, human \ncomputation is observed. This leads to a history of Human Computation even \nlonger than that of electronic computer. Now with the development of \nInternet web service, the workforce of human computation is broadened to a \nvast pool of crowds, e.g. Amazon Mechanic Turk, instead of designated \nexerts or employees. This type of outsourcing to crowds, a.k.a. \ncrowdsourcing, ushers in the new computation paradigm of Crowdsourced \nHuman Computation. Data-driven applications also benefit from the \ncrowdsourcing power, where the crowds are utilized as a data processing \nmodule.\n\nHowever, traditional crowd-powered task processing relies on centralized \nplatforms. These markets are specially designed based on a labor market \nstructure, which facilitates the task display and post-task payoff. But \nsuch mechanism also constrains the source of crowd workforce, which leads \nto difficulties in terms of quality control, cost management, as well as \nbias of worker demographics.\n\nIn this thesis, we elaborate the effort of employing online social users \nas another source of crowdsourcing workforce. We show that a most of \ndata-driven applications can be decomposed into binary decision making or \ninformation elicitation tasks for human workforce. Then we illustrate the \nmajority voting over the decision making as crowdsourced answer aggregator \nand discuss its properties. Moreover, there are three major challenges to \nestablish high-performance crowdsourcing applications onto online social \nusers as crowdsourcing workforce; therefore we present corresponding \ntechniques as follows:\nQuality: Jury-selection algorithms to solve \"Whom to Ask\" challenge to \nimprove answer quality under majority voting;\nCost: WiseMarket as a new crowdsourcing paradigm to conduct payment with \nless cost and higher quality;\nAuthenticity: COPE as an approach to elicit opinion from online crowds \nwith authenticity guarantee and cost control.\n\nIn the end, we show directions of future work in applying the data-driven \ncrowdsourcing via online social users.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 17 July 2014\n\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm - 4:00pm\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Jianan Qu (ECE)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Lei Chen (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Huamin Qu\n \t\t\tProf. Raymond Wong\n \t\t\tProf. Xuhu Wan (ISOM)\n                        Prof. Qing Li (Comp.

These recorded activities include phone calls, uses of Apps on \nsmartphones, and expression of opinions over social-network objects such as \nphotos. These activities and actions give rise to a huge amount of data. \nActivity recognition aims to understand users' actions and intentions based on \nmodels built from these data. Accurate activity recognition allows us to track \npeople's daily activities, to recognize the semantic functions of places, to \nhelp users and managers identify spammers in an online social network, and to \npredict the future activity levels of social-network users.\n\nIn this thesis, we study a special kind of activity recognition problems in \nwhich a social network structure is available or abundant social activity \nrecords are given as external knowledge sources. We call these two kinds of \nauxiliary knowledge sources as social knowledge. Utilizing them has two unique \nchallenges. First, how to utilize the rich knowledge in the social structure \nand model it for the activity recognition model for each user in the social \nnetwork. Second, while the data is abundant in general, sometimes the labeled \ndata is limited due to reasons such as short usage time and inactiveness of \nsome users and high cost to label data in both physical and virtual worlds. \nTransfer learning is a new learning framework that is suitable to model \nexternal knowledge sources and becomes especially effective when the target \nproblem domain suffers from data sparsity issues. In the past decade, transfer \nlearning has been successfully applied to application domains such as text \nmining, image understanding, and recommender systems. We propose a novel \ntransfer learning framework that uses auxiliary social knowledge to improve \nactivity recognition tasks, and apply it to four specific problems: social \nspammer detection, semantic place prediction, social activity level prediction, \nand heterogeneous transfer from online social activities to the physical world. \nOur experimental results on the four specific recognition tasks all demonstrate \nthe high effectiveness of the proposed transfer learning framework.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 21 July 2014\n\nTime:\t\t\t9:30am - 11:30am\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Bertram Shi (ECE)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Qiang Yang (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Raymond Wong\n \t\t\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung\n \t\t\tProf. Rong Zheng (ISOM)\n                        Prof. Irwin King (Comp.

As wireless signals may change overtime or \nsuddenly (due to addition/removal of APs, construction/tear-down of partitions, \nadjustment of AP powers, etc.), the fingerprint database needs to be updated \nregularly and frequently in order to achieve high localization accuracy. \nTraditionally the site is surveyed to collect the new radio signatures by means \nof trained surveyors or crowdsourcing.

Chameleon eliminates \nthe need of any surveyors or explicit user participation by making use of the \nsignals measured by the clients, thereby making clients as surveyors as well. \nIndependent of any fingerprint-based localization algorithm, it employs an \nefficient algorithm to filter out the altered AP (access point) signals to \nachieve highly accurate indoor localization.

Researchers have proposed, designed and \nimplemented various computation models and systems on different abstraction \nlevels, such as MapReduce, X10, Dryad, Storm and Spark. However, many \nabstractions expose the distributed detail of the platform to the application \nlayer, and lead to increased complexity in programming, decreased performance, \nand, sometimes, loss of generality. At the data substrate layer, traditional \ncloud computing technologies, such as MapReduce, use disk-based file systems as \nthe system-wide substrate for data storage and sharing. A distributed file \nsystem provides a global name space and stores data persistently, but it also \nintroduces significant overhead. Several recent systems use DRAM to store data \nand tremendously improve the performance of cloud computing systems. However, \nboth our own experience and related work indicate that a simple substitution of \ndistributed DRAM for the file system does not provide a solid and viable \nfoundation for data processing and storage in the datacenter environment, and \nthe capacity of such systems is limited by the amount of physical memory in the \ncluster.\n\nTo support general, efficient, flexible, and concurrent application workloads \nwith sophisticated data processing, we present programmers an illusion of a big \nvirtual machine built on top of one, multiple or many compute nodes and unify \nthe physical memory and disks of the nodes to form a globally addressable data \nsubstrate. We design a new instruction set architecture, i0, to unify myriads \nof compute nodes to form a big virtual machine called MAZE where thousands of \ntasks run concurrently in VOLUME, a large, unified, and snapshotted distributed \nvirtual memory. i0, MAZE and VOLUME form the foundation of the Layer Zero \nsystems which provide a general substrate for cloud computing. i0 provides a \nsimple yet general and scalable programming model. VOLUME mitigates the \nscalability bottleneck of traditional distributed shared memory systems and \nunifies the physical memory and disks on many compute nodes to form a \ndistributed transactional virtual memory. VOLUME provides a general \nmemory-based abstraction, takes advantage of DRAM in the system to accelerate \ncomputation, and, transparently to programmers, scales the system to process \nand store large datasets by swapping data to disks and remote servers. Along \nwith an efficient execution engine, the capacity of a MAZE can scale up to \nsupport large datasets and large clusters.\n\nWe have implemented the Layer Zero systems on several platforms, and designed \nand implemented various benchmarks, graph processing and machine learning \nprograms and application frameworks. Our evaluation shows that Layer Zero has \nexcellent performance and scalability. On one physical host, the system \noverhead is comparable to that of traditional VMMs. On 16 physical hosts, Layer \nZero runs 10 times faster than Hadoop and X10.

BRTs are also necessary in various software \nengineering research areas such as fault localization, automated program \nrepair and crash reproduction. However, it is extremely tedious and time \nconsuming to collect them manually. Consequently, most of the research \nresults in those areas are derived from small numbers of (8 to 119) bugs.\n\nIn this paper I propose an automatic approach of extracting BRTs from \nsoftware repositories. My approach automatically finds, downloads and \nbuilds meaningful revisions. Then my algorithm automatically finds BRTs by \nusing my definition of bugs and patches. Found BRTs are packaged with \nrelated data into readily usable forms. Using my approach, I collected \n1610 real-world BRTs from 891 bugs of 4 open source projects. I manually \nverified the collected bugs, and 72% of them were found to be real bugs. \nTo further evaluate the usefulness of collected BRTs, I ran a program \nrepair algorithm (GenProg) on them. A large number of BRTs allowed \nthorough analysis of the algorithm. I could identify a weakness of the \nalgorithm, which had been presumed but not been able to be proven before \nbecause only a small number of BRTs had been available: many of its \npatches (71.4%) were nonsensical.

The multi-resolution scheme employs \none of two popular time alignment algorithms, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) \nor Correlation Optimized Warping (COW), as the optimization algorithm, \nwhile Kullback-Leibler Distance (KLD) is used as the local similarity \nmeasure. We have validated the proposed scheme using two real-world data \nsets, which include both high mass accuracy and low mass accuracy LC-MS \nimages. In addition, we have also compared the results with an existing \nalignment algorithm, the Dynamic Time Warping-Component Detection \nAlgorithm (DTW-CODA). The experiments show that the proposed scheme \noutperforms DTW-CODA, and is a promising approach for aligning both high \nmass accuracy and low mass accuracy LC-MS images.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 19 August 2014\n\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm - 4:00pm\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 4483\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Albert Chung (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tDr. Henry Lam (CBME) (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung (Chairperson)\n \t\t\tDr. Huamin Qu\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["MULTI-RESOLUTION LC-MS IMAGE ALIGNMENT SCHEME"], "lenArticle": 280},

Social choice theory studies such preference \naggregation methods systematically. One of the problems that social choice \ntheorists cares the most is voter manipulation. The Gibbard-Satterthwaite \nimpossibility theorem states that there is no reasonable social choice \nfunction that is free from voter manipulation. In an election there are \nnot only voters, but also candidates who can think strategically as well. \nIn this thesis, we study the strategic behaviors of a candidate in two \nscenarios: voting with partial information, and open-list proportional \nrepresentation.\n\nTraditional social choice theory assumes that voters preferences are \ntotal orders on the set of candidates. Voting with partial information \nstudies what happens before an election when voters' preferences are given \nby partial orders, and the outcomes of the elections may still be open. In \nthis case, a candidate may be interested in knowing if it is still \npossible for him to win, and if so, how he can win. To address these \nproblems, we consider various forms of queries that candidates can query \nthe voters to elicit their preferences and minimal sets of such queries to \nask in order to determine the outcome of the election with respect to the \ncandidate. Our main technical results are that for pair-wise comparison \nqueries, there is a unique minimal set and to compute such minimal set is \nin general computationally hard.\n\nAnother setting where candidates or political parties need to think \nstrategically is in open-list proportional representation. In this thesis \nwe consider open-list proportional representation used in Hong Kong \nLegislative Council Geographical Committee election. In this election, \nvoters vote on lists of candidates. The strategies of the parties are to \nmake up lists of candidates, either on their own or with other parties so \nas to win maximal number of seats. In this thesis we consider the simple \ncase when there are just two parties, and model it as a competitive game \nbetween the two parties, characterize their strategies and analyze the \nequilibrium of this game.

New PHY and MAC layer enhancements have been introduced in \ndifferent IEEE 802.11 WLAN standards. These improvements have given birth to a \nwide range of bandwidth channels (up to 160MHz) and very high transmission data \nrates (> 1Gbps) to keep up with current and upcoming multimedia applications. \nOptimizing the performance of different wireless networks for emerging network \napplications is an important and highly challenging issue.\n\nQoS is very important for high throughput WLANs. Scheduling the access of flows \nin a non-interfering manner to avoid packet loss and adapting rates to changing \nchannel conditions are important aspects of QoS in wireless networks. The goal \nof the rate adaptation scheme is to select the best set of transmission \nparameters for a given user considering its channel quality. Similarly, \nsub-channel scheduling access can be seen as selecting the best set of users to \nallocate subcarriers according to their channel state information. As data \ntraffic has diverse characteristics and different transmission requests, an \nadvanced version of Multimedia-MAC should exist to dynamically adjust the \nbandwidth allocation according to the instant traffic load status so that both \nnetwork channel utilization and QoS for different types of traffic streams are \ndramatically enhanced.\n\nThis thesis makes two main contributions. The first is a design a new practical \nrate control algorithm for 802.11n WLANs, based on a probing system that \nguarantees that it is has Long-Term Stability and Short-Term Responsiveness \n(L3S). We then implement it in commercial devices using the Ath9k driver \nwithout modifications to the existing standard. The new rate adaptation \nclassifies transient and sustained changes in the link conditions. Then, it \ncontrols both short-term and long-term channel quality variations respectively \nby continuously monitoring the transmission history and intelligently probing \nat new data rates that may outperform the current one. Our proposed rate \ncontrol algorithm adapts rapidly to these changes by adjusting the efficient \ntransmission rate. Thus, it optimizes the throughput (or delay) performance on \na wireless link. The second part consequently deals with the major reasons for \nthe inefficiency of different WLANs. The current MAC layer randomly allocates \nthe entire channel to only one user as a single resource. Indeed, one way to \nsignificantly improve WLAN performance is to effectively reduce the channel \nwidth and create different sized sub-channels. Based on the user's channel \nconditions and QoS requirements, the Physical layer resources can be \ndynamically allocated to several users at the same time. Thus, we present a \nnovel sub-channels access approach, titled MU-Access, with new features \nsuitable for the forthcoming high-speed MIMO-based WLAN products. We shall \nevaluate its performance compared to state-of-the-art systems, using NS-3 under \na variety of network conditions. Our experiments then demonstrate that our \nscheme does indeed enhance IEEE 802.11 device performance with a much higher \ndegree of throughput. Also, we propose to profit from the sub-channels access \napproach and adapt the rate separately for each block of subcarriers according \nto the instantaneous channel conditions, for improvement.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 22 August 2014\n\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm - 4:00pm\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Amine Bermak (ECE)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Mounir Hamdi (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Jogesh Muppala (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Brahim Bensaou\n \t\t\tProf. Gary Chan\n \t\t\tProf. Khaled Ben Letaief (ECE)\n \t\t\tProf. Chengshan Xiao (Elec. & Comp.

However, the \r\nRFID technique also raises privacy and security requirements, which if not \r\nwell resolved, may hinder its broad deployment in the supply chain \r\nsetting. In this thesis, we analyze the privacy and security requirements \r\nof four critical RFID-enabled supply chain applications and devise the \r\ncorresponding security solutions. We briefly summarize our results as \r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nOur first application is RFID-enabled Batch recall. We leverage RFID \r\ntechnique to implement batch recall in an accurate and efficient way. \r\nRFID-enabled batch recall provides us the opportunity to further enhance \r\nthe security of batch recall operation, allowing us to achieve recognition \r\nof problematic products, privacy preserving of production pattern, recall \r\nauthentication and non-repudiation, etc. We thoroughly study the security \r\naspects and identify the unique requirements in RFID-enabled batch recall. \r\nWe propose a practically secure protocol, COLLECTOR, to enable accurate, \r\nsecure and efficient RFID batch recall.\r\n\r\nOur second application is RFID-enabled anti-counterfeiting. We investigate \r\nthe new opportunity provided by the RFID technique to solve this problem \r\nand identify a critical requirement: balance the tradeoff between the \r\nprivacy and efficiency. We design a bidirectional efficiency-privacy \r\ntransferable (BEST) authentication protocol to achieve this requirement. \r\nIn a relatively secure domain, BEST works in an efficient manner to \r\nauthenticate batches of tags with less privacy guarantee. Once the tags \r\nflow into open environment, BEST can migrate to provide stronger privacy \r\nprotection to the tags with moderate efficiency degradation.\r\n\r\nOur third and fourth applications are RFID-enabled product data sharing in \r\ndata-on-tag manner and data-on-network manner, respectively. Sharing \r\nproduct data in a supply chain enables the involved participants to track \r\nproducts accurately. In the two applications, we investigate two new \r\napproaches of RFID technique to facilitate product data sharing, namely, \r\ndata-on-tag approach and data-on-network approach.

To better build, \nunderstand, maintain, optimize, and upgrade such large distributed \nnetworks, it is important to design economic mechanisms as well as \ntechnologies. Past history has shown that sound technologies based on pure \nengineering considerations can fail to get adopted. Now the wireless \nnetworks are also at the cutting edge of their evolution, where dynamic \nspectrum accessing and cognitive radio technologies bring economics and \nincentive issues to the fore. There are opportunities to build economic \nincentives into the network architecture and protocols under development, \nand avoid the many problems that have arisen on the previous network \nsystem design due to their lack thereof. We discuss five typical scenarios \nin wireless network scenarios. The first one is about the cooperation \nscheme design for wireless service providers. We show that opportunities \nthat they can cooperate widely exist and through cooperation they address \nthe shortage of spectrum resource easily and economical efficiently. Then \nwe study the deployment and management problems in Macro-femto \nheterogeneous networks from business models and technical solutions \naspects. We classify the models into three categories: joint-deployment, \nWSP-deployment, and user-deployment. Their unique characteristics, \ncorresponding challenges and potential solutions are further explored to \nprovide a deeper insight from the systematic point of view. We also \npresent a scheme on the WSPs revenue maximization under the WSP-deployment \ncase. In the third work, we propose a cooperation framework for a mobile \noperator and a fixed-line operator. Through combining their fixed-line \ninfrastructures and spectrum resources, femtocells can be deployed and \nmanaged. We consider both the technical and economical factors. A unique \nclosed-form equilibrium is derived by Nash bargaining model, which is fair \nand efficient and thus amenable to the operators. In the fourth work, we \npropose a three-stage auction-based framework for spectrum group-buying. \nAs an individual user may not be from the same secondary networks with \nothers and he can not afford a whole channel by his own, it is feasible to \ngroup them together and bid for the same channel. The framework takes into \naccount users limited budgets and different evaluations of channels as \nwell as fairness and efficiency. In the last work, we jointly study the \nspectrum holder's strategy in auction and the WSPs\u2019 strategies in service \nprovisions. We point out the relationship between their optimal \nstrategies. To meet the WSP's flexible requirements, we design Flexauc, a \nnovel auction mechanism to enables WSPs to bid for a dynamic number of \nchannels. We prove theoretically that Flexauc not only maximizes the \nsocial welfare but also preserves other nice properties: truthfulness and \ncomputational tractability.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 6 June 2013\n\nTime:\t\t\t3:00pm - 5:00pm\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Tao Zhu (ECON)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Mounir Hamdi (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Qian Zhang (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Lei Chen\n \t\t\tProf. Lin Gu\n \t\t\tProf. Wai-Ho Mow (ECE)\n                        Prof. Xiaohua Jia (Comp.

To automate crash\nreproduction, many capture-replay approaches have been proposed. These\napproaches capture software executions and reliably reproduce the captured\nexecutions. However, these approaches usually incur substantial\nperformance overhead. Alternatively, post-failure-process approaches such\nas Windows Error Reporting System and Google Breakpad collect memory dumps\nor stack traces after crashes occurred. Since these approaches do not\nincur any additional performance overhead, they are widely used in\npractice. The information collected from post-failure-process approaches\nis used to prioritize debugging effort and provide debugging hints for\ndevelopers. Eventually, developers need to manually reproduce crashes\nusing the information, which requires non-trivial effort. In this\nproposal, I propose an automatic crash reproduction framework, STAR, which\ncan reproduce crashes using only the crash stack trace information. The\nframework can generate crash reproducible test cases without incurring\nperformance overhead to real world executions.\n\n\nDate:                   Thursday, 13 June 2013\n\nTime:                   10:00am - 12:00noon\n\nVenue:                  Room 3501\n                        Lifts 25/26\n\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Sunghun Kim (Supervisor)\n                        Dr. Charles Zhang (Chairperson)\n \t\t\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["STAR: Stack Trace based Automatic Crash Reproduction"], "lenArticle": 204},

To ensure that a code change \ndoes not break the design and functionality of the software, developers \nusually review newly committed changes for quality assurance. Compared to \nformal code inspection that is typically labor-intensive and \ntime-consuming, reviewing code changes is more frequent and lightweight. \nIn fact, due to the evolving nature of software systems, such a \nlightweight practice is trending as the modern way of code review.\n\nA fundamental step of code change review is the comprehension of source \ncode changes. In this paper, we report a systematic literature survey on \nthe practices, techniques, and challenges of code change comprehension. \nFirst, we explore common practices and information needs in modern code \nreview that focuses exclusively on source code changes. We then present \ntechniques that have been proposed to aid code change comprehension, \nfollowed by a discussion on the similarities and differences between code \nchange comprehension and program comprehension techniques. With this \nknowledge of the state-of-the-art research, we identify major challenges \nof code change comprehension that are caused by insufficient tool support \nand developers\u2019 not-so-recommended commit practices.

There are many research topics along the whole process, including \r\ndata capture, alignment, registration, segmentation, and modelling. My research \r\nwork is related to some of these topics.\r\n\r\nWe design and implement a simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) \r\nsystem. This system is composed of a monocular SLAM (mono-SLAM) component and a \r\nstereo SLAM components. The mono-SLAM can run individually and the result can \r\nbe enhanced by the stereo SLAM if the data captured by a stereo camera pair is \r\nadded. With stereo SLAM, the similarity $3$D reconstruction can be upgraded to \r\nmetric reconstruction. We solve the similarity transformation between \r\nsimilarity reconstruction and metric reconstruction, and update the \r\ntransformation online for every newly input frames.\r\n\r\nWe did some research on 3D point clouds processing and modeling. We first \r\naddress the problem of separating objects from 3D scanned point clouds of urban \r\nscene. The proposed approach hierarchically performs the grouping from the 3D \r\npoints to curve segments, object elements, and finally objects. The main \r\ncontribution lies in grouping object primitives to objects. We introduce the \r\nrelation attributes that describe relations for pairs of object primitives, \r\nlearn a preference function over such attributes via ranking-SVM which is used \r\nto compute the degree that two object primitives belong to an object, and \r\nfinally merge object elements that are very likely to be contained in the same \r\nobject. Unlike previous 3D points segmentation algorithms that require object \r\npriors to annotate 3D points, our approach only exploits the relation prior \r\nthat is not limited to any specific object and can separate general urban \r\nobjects. Experimental  results over large scale real urban scenes demonstrate \r\nour approach is effective to object separation.\r\n\r\nWe also present an automatic approach to reconstruct 3D road network models as \r\na part of 3D cities from terrestrial LiDAR and photo data. Comparing to aerial \r\ndata, terrestrial data provide much higher resolution and bring us superior \r\nreconstruction quality. However, the common terrestrial LiDAR data suffer from \r\nocclusion, inconsistency between multiple scans, and the lack of topology \r\ninformation. Moreover, since the road network coverage of a city is too large \r\nto be modeled as a single entity, it is crucial to partition the full set of \r\ndata into smaller parts and model each of them individually. Unlike the \r\nprevious approaches of point clouds segmentation and modeling that do not take \r\nthe knowledge of road structures into account, we introduce the prior knowledge \r\nof roads in the form of 2D topology maps, which are widely available on \r\nInternet, e.g., OpenStreetMap, to assist the reconstruction of roads. After the \r\npoint clouds of roads are segmented from the input data, a cross-domain \r\nalignment method is designed to align the scanning point clouds and 2D topology \r\nmaps.\r\n\r\nTopology-aware partition is further used to break the point clouds and images \r\ninto manageable partitions so that a model for each partition can be generated \r\nand textured by the captured photos. Finally, all individual partitions are \r\nmerged to a global consistent model. We use a graph-based method to \r\nautomatically select best partitions to generate textures of the road with the \r\nconsideration of both accuracy and consistency. A novel method designed for \r\ntexture generation from rolling shutter image is proposed.

Thus the performance and dependability \r\ncharacteristics of data centers will have significant impact on the scalability \r\nof these services. In particular, the data center network needs to be agile and \r\nreconfigurable in order to respond quickly to ever changing application demands \r\nand service requirements. Significant research work has been done on designing \r\nthe data center network topologies in order to improve the performance of data \r\ncenters.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, we first present a abstract survey of data center network \r\ndesigns and topologies that have published recently. We start with a discussion \r\non various representative data center network topologies, and compare them with \r\nrespect to several properties in order to highlight their advantages and \r\ndisadvantages. A good understanding of the state-of-the-art in data center \r\nnetworks would enable the design of future architectures in order to improve \r\nperformance and dependability of data centers.\r\n\r\nWith the plethora of data center network (DCN) topologies that have been \r\nproposed in the literature, there is a sore need for a standardized method for \r\nevaluating and comparing various alternate DCN architectures. Considering these \r\nneeds, we designed DCNSim, a general purpose DCN simulator that supports most \r\nwell-known DCN topologies proposed in the literature. Our simulator can \r\ngenerate various metrics for the topologies, including static metrics like \r\naverage path length, aggregated bottleneck throughput, routing failure rate; \r\nand dynamic metrics like packet loss rate, average buffer size and link \r\nutilization. The modular and flexible architecture of the simulator permits \r\neasy extension to support any future proposed topologies and compute new \r\nmetrics.\r\n\r\nWith the support of DCNSim, we present an evaluation of the fault-tolerance \r\ncharacteristics of several important data center network topologies. These \r\nenable us to present an objective comparison of the network topologies under \r\nfaulty conditions. The concept of fault region is useful to describe associated \r\nfailures.\r\n\r\nOptical data center networks (DCNs) are becoming increasingly popular for their \r\ntechnological advantages including flexibility and high bandwidth.

Although the\r\ncapability of the conventional single-antenna hardware continues to\r\ngrow, the demand of mobile data traffic grows even faster. With\r\nregards to the ever-growing demands of mobile data, considering merely\r\nthe limited time and frequency domains is not sufficient anymore, the\r\npreviously unused spatial domain is then exploited and\r\nMultiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) is the emerging technique in\r\nthis field which exploits the spatial properties of wireless channels\r\nto achieve significant system gains, without the expense of additional\r\nbandwidth by taking advantages of spatial multiplexing and/or spatial\r\ndiversity. Though MIMO can boost the network capacity to some extent,\r\nit has its own limitations to deal with the further growing demands of\r\nwireless data, i.e., the throughput of this design is always limited\r\nby the number of antennas equipped in the devices. Since the APs/BSs\r\ngenerally have much more antennas then each mobile client devices, in\r\norder to further increase the network capacity, it is then attractive\r\nto allow multiple clients to concurrently communicate with the AP/BS\r\nby using Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO).\r\n\r\nIn this survey, we will examine the design and inherent\r\ncharacteristics of the recent advances in both MIMO and MU-MIMO.\r\nSpecifically, we will focus on the state-of-the-art working systems\r\nand applications in this area.

The most essential module in \r\nsuch prevalent LBSs is to determine the location\u00a0of the object, known as \r\nindoor localization. With marvelous development of wireless systems in \r\nrecent\u00a0years, wireless technologies have been applied to support myriad of \r\nLBSs.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we survey the existing recent advances for wireless indoor \r\nlocalization in two main\u00a0categories, namely device-based and \r\ndevice-free,\u00a0according to whether specific device is carried by the \r\ntarget. The most commonly device carried by people is smartphone.\u00a0With a \r\nvariety of built-in hardware (e.g., GPS,\u00a0camera, WiFi, FM radio and \r\ninertial sensors), this mobile platform constitutes a good possibility \r\nfor\u00a0indoor localization. We present in-depth analysis of corresponding \r\ntechniques categorized by different\u00a0modal, including schemes with single \r\ntechnique, and data fusion methods using multiple techniques. We also \r\nfigure\u00a0out the rationale of techniques\u00a0relying on dedicated hardware such \r\nas Ultrasonic radar, Infrared and RFID.\u00a0In addition, we comprehensively \r\ncompare these techniques and summarize the results on accuracy, cost, \r\nscalability and energy\u00a0consumption.\u00a0For specific scenarios\u00a0like\u00a0intrusion \r\ndetection and\u00a0safety precaution\u00a0when device-based methods are \r\nimpractical,\u00a0device-free approaches are more promising.

In this thesis proposal \r\nwe address the design and experiment of overlay network for delivering \r\nhigh quality video globally via public Internet. In overlay streaming, \r\nproxies are placed at different locations of the Internet to serve end \r\nusers from various regions. The proxies form a scalable, distributed \r\noverlay structure and video streams are \u201cpushed\u201d down from the streaming \r\nsource to all proxies. In order to achieve good quality of service, the \r\noverlay network needs to be designed to have low source-to-end delay, to \r\nsupport high bitrate and heterogeneous streaming rate requirements.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis we first study the design of a low-delay high-bandwidth \r\nbackbone for overlay live streaming. We propose an efficient push-based \r\nmultitree algorithm called \u201cFastMesh\u201d to construct the overlay, which \r\naccommodates asymmetric and diverse uplink bandwidth, and continuously \r\nimproves delay based on existing nodes. We examine the feasibility of \r\n1Mbps streaming through a global measurement study on our fine-grained \r\nexperiment platform.\r\n\r\nThen we further push the streaming rate limit to beyond 1Mbps. To achieve \r\nglobal streaming over public Internet with higher streaming rate (multi- \r\nMbps), we study the use of proxy helper to provide rich path diversity and \r\novercome bandwidth bottlenecks. We formulate a problem of proxy streaming, \r\nand propose a centralized algorithm that efficiently constructs high \r\nbandwidth overlay with helpers. We also conduct a serial of global \r\nmeasurement studies of our helper network using proxies at multiple sites \r\nwith various geographical footprint.\r\n\r\nIn the end we address the problem of reliability and user heterogeneity. \r\nWe formulate an optimization problem using MDC with the consideration of \r\nstreaming continuity and heterogeneous bitrate requirements.

Traditionally \r\na voter's preference is represented by a total order on the set of \r\ncandidates. However, sometimes one may not have complete information about \r\na voter's preference, and in this case, can only model a voter's \r\npreference as a partial order. Given this framework, there has been work \r\non computing the possible and necessary winners of a (partial) profile. In \r\nthis proposal, we extend the concept of partial profile to include the \r\nmore general partial information about a voter's preference. We also take \r\na step further, look at sets of questions to ask in order to determine the \r\noutcome of such a partial profile. Specifically, we call a set of \r\nquestions a deciding set for a candidate if the outcome of the vote for \r\nthe candidate is determined no matter how the questions are answered by \r\nthe voters, and a possible winning (losing) set if there is a way to \r\nanswer these questions to make the candidate a winner (loser) of the vote. \r\nWe discuss some interesting properties about these sets of queries, prove \r\nsome complexity results about them under some well-known voting rules such \r\nas plurality and Borda, and consider their application in vote \r\nelicitation. We also discuss the properties of different forms of \r\nquestions. Some question sets have a unique minimal deciding set in any \r\npartial profile under certain voting rules. We believe this implies that \r\nthe question set is proper for the voting rule. So we further discuss what \r\nkind of questions sets has a unique minimal deciding set in any partial \r\nprofile under any voting rule. And we give examples of question sets and \r\nvoting rules that have a unique minimal deciding set in any partial \r\nprofile, and examples that does not. We take plurality as an example to \r\nillustrate the usefulness of minimal deciding sets in vote elicitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Friday, 19 April 2013\r\n\r\nTime:                   3:00pm - 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 5506\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Fangzhen Lin (Supervisor)\r\n                         Prof. Mordecai Golin (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["What Questions to Ask in Voting with Partial Information"], "lenArticle": 366},

Thus, unlike the \r\ncorresponding problem in deterministic databases where the frequent \r\nitemset has a unique definition, the frequent itemset under uncertain \r\nenvironments has two different definitions so far. The first definition, \r\nreferred as the expected support-based frequent itemset, employs the \r\nexpectation of the support of an itemset to measure whether this itemset \r\nis frequent. The second definition, referred as the probabilistic frequent \r\nitemset, uses the probability of the support of an itemset to measure its \r\nfrequency. Thus, existing work on mining frequent itemsets over uncertain \r\ndatabases is divided into two different groups and no study is conducted \r\nto comprehensively compare the two different definitions. In addition, \r\nsince no uniform experimental platform exists, current solutions for the \r\nsame definition even generate inconsistent results. In this survey, we \r\nfirstly aim to clarify the relationship between the two different \r\ndefinitions. Through extensive experiments, we verify that the two \r\ndefinitions have a tight connection and can be unified together when the \r\nsize of data is large enough. Secondly, we provide baseline \r\nimplementations of eight existing representative algorithms and test their \r\nperformances with uniform measures fairly. Finally, according to our \r\nexperimental evaluations over many different benchmark data sets, we \r\nclarify several existing inconsistent conclusions and discuss some new \r\nfindings.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Monday, 3 September 2012\r\n\r\nTime:                   1:30pm - 3:30pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Lei Chen (Supervisor)\r\n                         Prof. Frederick Lochovsky (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\r\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["A Survey on Mining Frequent Itemsets over Uncertain Databases"], "lenArticle": 299},

The underlying reason is\r\nthat the development of MT systems in the past decade has been driven\r\nby fast and cheap lexical n-gram based MT evaluation metrics which\r\nfail to reflect translation utility. Even when human judgment clearly\r\nindicates that one sentence translation is significantly more\r\nmeaningful, lexical similarity based evaluation metrics typically\r\nregister little difference. Semantic role labels (SRL) capture the\r\nessential meaning of a sentence in the basic event structure - ``who\r\ndid what to whom, when, where, why and how''. As the performance of\r\nflat n-gram oriented SMT have plateaued, we argue that it is time for\r\na new SRL based evaluation metric that focuses on getting the meaning\r\nright to drive the continuous improvement of MT towards the direction\r\nof higher utility.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, we first introduce HMEANT, the human-involved\r\nprototype of SRL based MT evaluation metric, that produces scores that\r\ncorrelate better with human adequacy judgment than HTER, the\r\nstate-of-the-art non-automatic adequacy-oriented MT evaluation metric,\r\nbut at a lower labor cost. We then show that MEANT, the fully\r\nautomatic MT evaluation metric, correlates better with human judgment\r\non translation adequacy than the most commonly used automatic MT\r\nevaluation metric. Most importantly, we present the first result of\r\ntraining MT system produces MT output on MEANT that achieve improved\r\nscores across most commonly used metrics.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Tuesday, 4 September 2012\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Dekai Wu (Supervisor)\r\n                         Prof. Fangzhen Lin (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung\r\n \t\t\tDr. Pascale Fung (ECE)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["MEANT: A highly accurate automatic metric for evaluating translation utility via semantic role labels"], "lenArticle": 346},

With the development of the Internet, ER for \nhidden Web data has become increasingly important in many real-world \napplications such as online search engines, web data integration and so \non. Hidden Web data often originates from different data sources that \nusually have different schemas. As a consequence, there is no one most \nefficient way to compare and merge records from different schemas. \nMoreover, the existing proposed techniques that put all records together \nunder a unified schema are often not suitable.\n\nIn this thesis, we investigate ER methods for hidden Web data using a \nmulti-schema approach. That is, we keep the data under the original \nschemas instead of placing them under a unified schema. Based on the \nmulti-schema structure, a pair-wise ER method validity-ensured and \norder-sensitive (VEOS) is proposed. For the rest parts of the thesis, we \nfirst propose two techniques for improving the performance of the VEOS \nmethod. Since duplicates that exist in the same data source may adversely \naffect recall performance, the first technique applies an expanding window \nto VEOS to enhance the recall performance. To reduce the number of record \npair comparisons, our second technique separates the records in large data \nsources into several blocks, so that only records in the blocks with the \nsame key values need to be compared. Then, we propose an efficient ER \nmethod for on-line query data integration, which self-trains the schema \nfields (attributes) so as to set appropriate weights, such that more \nrepresentative attributes will be used for the ER process.\n\nWe demonstrate through extensive experiments using real online data sets \nfrom different domains and some reasonable synthetic data sets, the \nscalability of the ER algorithms, the efficiency of the advanced VEOS \napproaches and the effectiveness of our proposed ER method for online \nquerying.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 6 September 2012\n\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Weichuan Yu (ECE)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Frederick Lochovsky (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Dik-Lun Lee\n \t\t\tProf. Qiong Luo\n \t\t\tProf. Rong Zheng (ISOM)\n                        Prof. Felix Naumann (Univ. of Potsdam)\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Entity Resolution for Hidden Web Data"], "lenArticle": 381},

In one project, our team was contracted by a buying agent for a \nlarge multi-national retailer to investigate better ways to formulate packing \nplans for the loading of goods into multiple containers. Typically, the goods \ncome in the form of 3D rectangular carton boxes, which are to be loaded into 3D \nrectangular containers of various standard sizes. Each type of container has a \ndifferent associated cost of shipping. The task is to select a set of \ncontainers that can contain all items while minimizing this shipping cost. \nProducts are loaded with faces parallel to the faces of the container, often \nknown as orthogonal packing in literature. We call this problem the Multiple \nContainer Loading Cost Minimization Problem (MCLCMP).\n\nIf a set of boxes can be loaded into a container, we call the set of boxes and \nthe associated container a loading pattern. MCLCMP can be naturally formulated \nas a set cover (SC) problem, where the set to be covered is the set of all \nboxes and a loading pattern ``covers'' a subset of boxes. We would like to \nselect loading patterns (from a set of candidates) to cover all boxes while \nminimizing the total cost of the associated containers. Our approaches to \nMCLCMP are essentially two-level approaches. The burden of finding feasible \nloading patterns is left to the lower level, where efficient algorithms for the \nSingle Container Loading Problem (SCLP) are needed. The higher level mainly \nfocuses on how to efficiently use the SCLP algorithms to produce candidate \nloading patterns and find good solutions to the set cover formulations.\n\nThe first part of my thesis concentrates on developing efficient algorithms for \nthe SCLP. Our approach and the best performing approaches in recent literature \nshare similar structures and can be broadly classified as block building \napproaches. We propose a conceptual model in to capture the common structure of \nthese block building approaches. In this conceptual model, a block building \napproach is dissected into six elements. Three of the six elements define the \nstates and transitions in the search space, two are heuristic rules that \nattempt to guide the search to more promising search regions, and the last \nelement is the overarching search strategy. By dissecting block building \napproaches into six elements, we can compare and contrast the various choices \nmade by existing algorithms for each element through both theoretical \ndiscussion and computational experiments. This conceptual model not only allows \nus to better understand the impact of various choices for each element, it also \nallows us to identify possible further research directions.\n\nThe second part of my thesis concentrates on how to efficiently solve the set \ncover formulation, where the main idea is to combine the strengths of the \nprototyping concept and the column generation technique. The prototyping \nconcept is similar to the one used in product design and software engineering. \nAlthough producing high quality loading patterns is time-consuming (roughly \nequivalent to solving SCLP), reasonable guesses for loading patterns can be \nmade quickly. We call such a guess a prototype, and using prototypes instead of \nactual loading patterns will allow us to explore a much larger set of \ncandidates in the set cover problem. If the prototypes are close to actual \nfeasible loading patterns (in terms of the number of boxes of each type \nloaded), then there is a high probability that we can convert the selected \nprototypes into actual loading patterns. Since a larger set of candidates leads \nto a better optimal solution for the corresponding set cover problem, we are \nmore likely to obtain a better solution to MCLCMP. Column generation is a \nstandard technique for solving linear programs with a huge number of decision \nvariables, where only a small set of columns is initially included and new \ncolumns are generated as needed by solving a pricing subproblem (in the matrix \nform of the set cover model, a column in the coefficient matrix represents a \nloading pattern). In the case of MCLCMP, the pricing subproblem is essentially \na variant of the SCLP.\n\nThe third part of my thesis proposes a new algorithm for the special case of \nthe MCLCMP where all containers are identical and boxes are not rotatable. This \nspecial case is the well-known 3D bin packing problem (3D-BPP). Our main idea \nis to model a feasible packing inside a bin as three comparability graphs. We \ncan then conveniently collate fragmented space in a bin to improve volume \nutilization.\n\nComputational experiments on standard benchmark data suggest that our proposed \nalgorithms for the SCLP, MCLCMP and 3D-BPP outperform all prior approaches.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 12 September 2012\n\nTime:\t\t\t9:00am - 11:00am\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3402\n \t\t\tLifts 17/18\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Yijing Yan (CHEM)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Siu-Wing Cheng (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Dimitris Papadias\n \t\t\tProf. Ke Yi\n \t\t\tProf. Xiangtong Qi (IELM)\n                        Prof. Yanzhi Li (Mgmt.

Most \nradio-based solutions require 1) priori knowledge of buildings, usually \nrepresented as a floor plan and 2) a process of site survey, in which radio \nsignatures of an interested area are annotated with their real recorded \nlocations. Floor plan plays an essential role in many indoor pervasive and \nmobile applications, but its collection and on-site calibration are \ninconvenient and usually prohibitively costly for map providers. Site survey \ninvolves intensive costs on manpower and time.\n\nIn this study, we investigate novel sensors integrated in modern mobile phones \nand leverage user motions to release the human efforts in constructing the \nradio map of a building. We propose Building Tomography, which automatically \nexplores indoor architectural layouts and samples radio fingerprints. Building \nTomography generates a floor plan illustrating a number of key spatial elements \nlike rooms, corridors, walls, and other physical features at one level of a \nbuilding, and constructs corresponding radio map towards it. Our idea is based \non human-centric sensing and crowdsourcing. The popularity of smartphones, with \nrich built-in sensors, enables fine-grained sensory records on human mobility \nand activity. Although the records from one user might be less useful, a large \namount of contributing users enrich the records to an applicable level so that \nthe interior layout of a building emerges.\n\nOur main contribution is to design and implement a building tomography system \nthat is inexpensive and pervasive. No building knowledge is required and all \nsensor readings are collected by off-the-shelf smartphones. To validate this \ndesign, we deploy a prototype system and conduct experiments in an office \nbuilding.

They outperform \nmagnetic disks on access speed, bandwidth, shock resistance, and power \nefficiency. As their capacity increases and prices decrease, flash disks are \nconsidered for the storage of database systems. Due to the differences in flash \nSSDs and magnetic disks, traditional data management techniques designed for \nmagnetic disks need to be re-examined for flash disks. In particular, the flash \nmemory used in flash disks has an asymmetry between read and write speeds, \nwhere reads, no matter random or sequential, are much faster than writes.\n\nThis thesis studies the performance of transactional workloads on flash disks \nand designs efficient storage schemes for them. Specifically, we begin with the \nperformance study of the TPC-C workload on flash SSDs. Overall, the flash SSDs \noutperform the magnetic disk by up to an order of magnitude. Moreover, the I/O \nperformance of the SSDs is dominated by random writes, whereas that of the \nmagnetic disk by random reads. Additionally, both minimising logging and \nadopting MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) than 2PL (Two-Phase Locking) \nhelps improve the performance on flash SSDs.\n\nObserving the dominance of random writes in flash SSDs under TPC-C workloads, \nwe propose a new database storage layout, called Partitioned Logging (PTL). In \nPTL, we replace data writes with logging to eliminate random page writes, and \nput data and logs into separate blocks. Moreover, we group data blocks into \npartitions so that updates on each partition are appended as log entries to one \nlog block. This way, we can tune the partition size to balance the read and \nwrite performance based on the hardware and workload characteristics. The \nresults show a considerable improvement over both the traditional storage and a \nleading flash-based database storage scheme.\n\nFinally, to solve the redundant I/O problem and eliminate merge operations that \nare essential in all the other log-structured approaches, we propose FlashTKV, \nwhich adopts a purely sequential storage format where all the data and \ntransactional information are log records. Furthermore, we support MVCC on this \nsequential storage efficiently. Our results show that FlashTKV improves the \ntransaction throughput by 70% over two well-known KV-stores under TPC-C \nworkloads on flash SSDs.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 19 June 2013\n\nTime:\t\t\t1:00pm \u2013 3:00pm\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Ellick Wong (MGMT)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Qiong Luo (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Frederick Lochovsky\n \t\t\tProf. Ke Yi\n \t\t\tProf. Zhiyong Fan (ECE)\n                       \tProf. Jeffrey Yu (Sys.

Two promising CBIR approaches are \nbased on bag-of-words (BoW) models and topic models (such as the latent \nDirichlet allocation, or LDA, model) as inspired by their success in text-based \ninformation retrieval applications. However, BoW models do not consider the \nspatial relationships and latent semantic relationships between words. Even \nthough topic models take into consideration the semantic information in \ndocuments, they still ignore the spatial information. Recent years have seen \nthe emergence of new methods which attempt to remedy the shortcomings of these \ntwo approaches. This thesis starts with a review of recent CBIR approaches that \nincorporate spatial and semantic information. With this as background, we \npropose two methods to combine the LDA model with spatial information. The \nfirst method, referred to as BoP+LDA, combines an extension of the BoW \nrepresentation called bag-of-phrases (BoP) with the LDA model. The second \nmethod, called ssLDA, incorporates image segmentation into the LDA model and \nre-ranks the retrieved images by exploiting topic spatial consistency. We \nempirically compare our proposed methods with some baseline methods on \nreal-world image data. From the experimental results, we conclude that \nincorporating both spatial and semantic information is effective in improving \nthe image retrieval performance.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 25 June 2013\n\nTime:\t\t\t10:00am \u2013 12:00noon\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Nevin Zhang (Chairperson)\n \t\t\tDr. Albert Chung\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Image Retrieval Using Spatial and Semantic Information"], "lenArticle": 280},

For \nexample, data integration of multiply data sources causes uncertainty. \nThus, mining probabilistic data (or called uncertain data in this thesis) \nhas become a hot research topic in recent years. In particular, since \nmining frequent patterns is one of the most fundamental problems in \ntraditional data mining researches, mining frequent patterns over \nprobabilistic databases has attracted much attention in the database and \nthe data mining communities. In the scenario of uncertain data, the \nsupport of an itemset is a discrete random variable rather than the \nfrequency of this itemset. Hence, unlike the corresponding problem in \ndeterministic databases where the frequent itemset has a unique \ndefinition, the frequent itemset under uncertain data has different \ndefinitions due to variation of probabilistic semantics, which even \ngenerate inconsistent results in current studies. However, the \nrelationship of different definitions and the inconsistent result has not \nyet been thoroughly identified and explored. Furthermore, like its \ncounterpart, mining frequent patterns in deterministic data, mining \nfrequent patterns over uncertain data cannot avoid an exponential number \nof frequent itemsets which causes the mining results less useful. In this \nthesis, we demonstrate how our solution can clarify the problems in \nexisting studies and address the challenge of an exponential number of \nmining results. Moreover, our solution is also well applied to \nconstructing effective indexes for query processing over other types of \nuncertain data, i.e., querying uncertain graphs. To summarize, our study \ncovers the following three aspects:\n\n1) We conduct a comprehensive experimental study of existing \nrepresentative frequent itemset mining algorithms over probabilistic \ndatabases and clarify several existing inconsistent conclusions;\n\n2) We propose a novel problem of mining probabilistic frequent closed \nitemsets in uncertain databases and design an efficient solution, which \nincludes a series of pruning techniques and an effective sampling \nalgorithm.\n\n3) We study the problem of efficient probabilistic supergraph containment \nquery and provide the efficient solution, which integrates probabilistic \nfrequent pattern mining technique for constructing the index.\n\nWe validate our solutions through extensive experiments and discuss \nseveral potential research directions of mining frequent patterns over \nprobabilistic databases.\n\n\nDate:                   Thursday, 11 July 2013\n\nTime:                   10:00am - 12:00noon\n\nVenue:                  Room 3501\n                         lifts 25/26\n\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Lei Chen (Supervisor)\n                        Prof. Frederick Lochovsky (Chairperson)\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Efficient Frequent Pattern Mining over Probabilistic Databases"], "lenArticle": 423},

Analyzing such data collected from \r\nhuman daily life can shed light into people\u2019s behaviors and thus has high \r\nsocial and commercial values. Mining or analyzing these kinds of data can \r\ninspire some very interesting applications such as extracting population\u2019s \r\nmobility pattern from mobile data, detecting anomalies from vehicle GPS \r\ndata, monitoring traffic and quickly responding to events by mining \r\nhistorical trajectory data, and analyzing peoples\u2019 spatio-temporal \r\nbehaviors with social and commercial values from their social check-in \r\ndata. Meanwhile, these data are usually noisy, sparse or incomplete, high \r\ndimensional, and contain both spatial and temporal attributes. Analysis of \r\na tremendous amount of such data is a very challenging task.  How to \r\nclearly summary and explore these complex features in data becomes an \r\nimportant problem. It is essential to present the data features in its \r\noriginal structure to prevent information loss and facilitate the analysis \r\nand at the same time provide users with some approaches to characterize \r\nunique patterns, compare different combinations of features, and quickly \r\nsearch anomalies.\r\n\r\nVisual analytics solutions show great potential as they can intuitively \r\npresent data\u2019s features including multi-dimensional, spatio-temporal \r\nattributes, and heterogonous structures and also provide rich \r\ninteractions, allowing users to explore the data and improve mining \r\nprocesses and results with their domain knowledge. It is important to keep \r\nhuman in the analysis loop to utilize the analyst\u2019s sense of the space and \r\ntime, tacit knowledge of their inherent properties and relationships, and \r\nspace / time -related experiences, which is hard to convey to machines. \r\nTargeting on the visual summarization and exploration in big data \r\nespecially those containing spatial temporal attributes, in this thesis, \r\nwe propose a set of visual summarization approaches on multi-dimensional \r\nspatio-temporal data, which cover different aspects of data visual \r\nanalysis issues.\r\n1) We propose a visual analytic approach, which integrated many \r\nwell-established visualization techniques such as parallel coordinates and \r\npixel-based representations to characterize data\u2019s mobility-related \r\nfeatures and summarize user groups inferred from the results.\r\n2) We develop a novel visualization method, Voronoi-diagram-based visual \r\ndesign to reveal the unique features related to flow in the data.  This \r\nvisualization method can better reveal the direction information when \r\ncomparing two adjacent flows of time-series data in a graph.\r\n3) We propose a new visual aided mining approach, Visual Fingerprinting \r\n(VF) for extremely large-scale spatio-temporal feature extraction and \r\nanalysis. The approach integrated important statistical and historical \r\ninformation and can be conveniently embedded into urban maps. The \r\nsophisticated design of the visualization can better reveal frequent or \r\nperiodic patterns for temporal attributes.\r\n4) Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our methods \r\nby conducting case studies on real datasets including mobile phone data, \r\ntaxi GPS data, and social check-in data.

Naive \r\nmaximum-likelihood (ML) estimation of infrequent triphone models produces \r\npoor triphone models and eventually affects the overall performance of an \r\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) system. Among different techniques \r\nproposed to solve the infrequent triphone problem, the most widely used \r\nmethod in current ASR systems is state tying because of its effectiveness \r\nin reducing model size and achieving good recognition results. However, \r\nstate tying inevitably introduces quantization errors since triphones tied \r\nto the same state are not distinguishable in that state. On the other \r\nhand, speaker adaptation techniques have been well developed over the past \r\ndecades. Speaker adaptation aims at adapting acoustic models to the \r\ncharacteristics of a particular speaker with a limited amount of speaker \r\nspecific data. Motivated by the idea of these speaker adaptation \r\ntechniques, we would like to solve the infrequent triphone problem from an \r\nadaptation point of view. In this proposal, we propose a new \r\ncontext-dependent modeling method called eigentriphones modeling. In \r\ncontrast to the state tying method, all the triphone models are distinct \r\nfrom each other and thus may be more discriminative. The rational behind \r\nour method is that a basis is derived over the frequent triphones and each \r\ninfrequent triphone is modeled as a point in the space spanned by the \r\nbasis. The eigenvectors in the basis represent the most important \r\ncontext-dependent characteristics among the triphones and thus the \r\ninfrequent triphones can be robustly modeled with few training samples. \r\nThe proposed eigentriphone modeling was empirically evaluated on the Wall \r\nStreet Journal 5K task and the TIMIT phoneme recognition task. It is shown \r\nthat our proposed method consistently performs better than the most common \r\nstate tying method.

Effective coordination among \r\nwireless stations can dramatically reduce radio interference and avoid \r\npacket collisions. Therefore, how to provide cost-effective coordination \r\nmechanisms becomes a critical problem in wireless design.\r\n\r\nMotivated\u00a0by this, we present a novel PHY layer technique termed \r\nAttachment Transmission to provide an extra control panel with minimum \r\noverhead. Attachment transmission enables control messages to be \r\ntransmitted along with data packets, and do not degrade the effective \r\nthroughput of the original data packets. We apply attachment transmission \r\nto a number of classic problems in wireless networks, including \r\nmulti-channel\u00a0allocation\u00a0problem,\u00a0hidden\u00a0terminal\u00a0problem\u00a0and exposed \r\nproblem.

Recently, with the \r\nadvent of OSNs (online social networks), more and more online social activities \r\nalso start to emerge. In this proposal, we aim to provide solutions for \r\nrecognizing human activities both in the physical world and in the virtual \r\nworld. We start by surveying related works in these two areas and then study \r\nsome specific challenges which are important to deploy these activity \r\nrecognition systems in the real world.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we investigate a number of specific problems we need to tackle \r\nwhen deploying activity recognition techniques in the real-world. We first \r\nanalyze how to recognize multiple activities in the physical world environment, \r\nespecially when such activities have concurrent and interleaving relationships. \r\nNext, we extend such a framework into the virtual world, by exploiting the \r\nrelatedness of search queries to activities with interleaving relationships and \r\npropose a context-aware query classification algorithm. Secondly, we study the \r\nproblem of recognizing abnormal activities. These abnormal activities are rare \r\nto happen and it is difficult to collect enough training data about them. We \r\ndevelop an algorithm based on the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process and the \r\none-class Support Vector Machine to recognize abnormal activities when the \r\ntraining data is scarce. Finally, when we need to deploy the activity \r\nrecognition systems in the real-world, it is impractical for us to collect \r\nenough training data for different activity recognition scenarios, especially \r\nwhen we need to collect training data for different persons and even for \r\ndifferent actions.

To keep up with the hardware innovation, software \r\ndevelopers are undergoing a revolution from sequential programming to \r\nconcurrent programming. This revolution, however, is slow and challenging due \r\nto the exponential complexity in reasoning about concurrency. In particular, \r\nHeisenbugs such as data races which are non-deterministic pervasively infect \r\nconcurrent software, making concurrent program debugging notoriously difficult.\r\n\r\nIn this dissertation, we develop several effective methods for debugging \r\nconcurrent programs along four directions: multiprocessor deterministic replay, \r\npredictive trace analysis, trace simplification, and data sharing reduction. We \r\nfirst present LEAP, a lightweight record and replay system that makes \r\nHeisenbugs reproducible on multi-core and multi-processors. Underpinned by a \r\nnew local-order based replay theorem, LEAP is fast, portable, and \r\ndeterministic. As long as a Heisenbug manifests once, LEAP is able to \r\ndeterministically reproduce it in every subsequent execution, and more \r\nimportantly, with much lower overhead compared to previous approaches.\r\n\r\nWe second present PECAN and TraceFilter, a persuasive predictive trace analysis \r\nsystem that predicts Heisenbugs from normal executions, and an efficient \r\nalgorithm that significantly improves the scalability of predictive analysis by \r\nremoving the trace redundancy. The salient feature of PECAN is that, in \r\naddition to predict Heisenbugs, it generates \u201cbug hatching clips\u201d that \r\ndeterministically expose and validate the predicted bugs. With PECAN, \r\nprogrammers are provided with the full execution history and context \r\ninformation to understand the bug, which dramatically expedites the debugging \r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nWe third present LEAN and SimTrace, a dynamic and a static technique for \r\nsimplifying concurrency bug reproduction through removing the computation \r\nredundancy and validating the trace equivalence. A simplified execution with \r\nfewer threads, fewer thread interleavings, and faster replay greatly reduces \r\nthe debugging effort by reducing the number of places in the trace where we \r\nneed to look for the cause of the bug and by speeding up the bug reproduction \r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nWe finally present Privateer, an execution privatization technique that soundly \r\nprivatizes a subset of shared data accesses in a vast category of \r\nscheduler-oblivious concurrent programs. Underpinned by a privatization \r\ntheorem, Privateer safely reduces the data sharing and isolates the erroneous \r\nthread interleavings without introducing any additional synchronization. With \r\nPrivateer, many Heisenbugs are fixed and a wide range of concurrency problems \r\nare alleviated without impairing but, instead, improving the program \r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 29 November 2012\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t9:00am \u2013 11:00am\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3408\r\n \t\t\tLifts 17/18\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Xueqing Zhang (CIVL)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Charles Zhang (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung\r\n \t\t\tProf. Lin Gu\r\n \t\t\tProf. Jiang Xu (ECE)\r\n                         Prof. Thomas Ball (Microsoft Research, USA)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Thesis Defenses"], "lenArticle": 450},

Driven by the advances in Internet and sensor techniques, the amount of \r\nmultidimensional contents, such as images, trajectories, video clips, etc., has \r\ngrown to an unprecedented level. Supporting multidimensional objects in large \r\nscale requires significant extensions from traditional databases. One critical \r\nissue is indexing and query processing. In this thesis, we discuss two \r\nimportant queries in massive multidimensional datasets: frequent path finding \r\nand high-dimensional similarity join. In the context of big data, these two \r\nqueries are challenging due two reasons: 1) they both contain expensive \r\ncomparison operations, and 2) the complex structures of their interested data \r\ncomplicate the index design. To address these issues, we conduct theoretical \r\nanalysis, advanced algorithm design, as well as extensive experiments on \r\nlarge-scale datasets.\r\n\r\nFirst, we address the problem of frequent path finding by proposing a new \r\nproblem named the Most Frequent Path with Temporal Constraints (MFPTC). \r\nSpecifically, given a set of time periods T, a source s, and a destination d, \r\nMFPTC query aims at computing the Most Frequent Path (MFP) from s to d during \r\nT. This query not only reveals the common routing preferences of the past \r\ntravelers, but also considers the time effectiveness of MFP. To reflect the \r\ncommon sense notion of frequent paths, we further propose a novel MFP \r\ndefinition that satisfies three key properties: suffix-optimal, \r\nlength-insensitive, and bottleneck-free. Assuming that all trajectories have \r\nbeen matched to a road network, we solve the MFPTC problem in two major steps. \r\nFirst, we develop efficient footmark construction algorithms to calculate the \r\npath frequencies by constructing a weighted sub-graph of the road network \r\ncalled footmark graph. Specifically, to deal with very large datasets, we \r\ndevise two index structures to reduce the number of trajectories need to be \r\nfetched from the disk. Second, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm to \r\nsearch the MFP in the footmark graph using a \"more frequent\" relation defined \r\nover path frequencies.\r\n\r\nSecond, we study how to perform parallel high-dimensional similarity joins \r\n(HDSJs) in MapReduce efficiently in the MapReduce paradigm. Particularly, we \r\npropose a cost model to demonstrate that it is important to take both \r\ncommunication cost and computation cost into account as dimensionality and data \r\nvolume increases. To this end, we propose DAA (Dimension Aggregation \r\nApproximation), an efficient compression approach that can help significantly \r\nreduce both these costs when performing parallel HDSJs. Moreover, we design \r\nDAA-based parallel HDSJ algorithms which can scale up to massive data sizes and \r\nvery high dimensionality.\r\n\r\nFinally, we conduct comprehensive experiments using real large-scale datasets. \r\nThe number of trajectories for path finding is up to 10 million and the average \r\ntrajectory length (in terms of the number of vertices) is 21. The number of \r\nimage vectors for join is up to 1 million and the dimensionality of the vectors \r\nis up to ten thousand.

As the size of the data is \r\ncontinuously growing, it will outgrow the capabilities of any serial \r\nprocessing techniques and it is therefore necessary to perform the data \r\nanalytics in parallel.\r\n\r\nThere are two main paradigms for large scale data processing: parallel \r\nrelational database management system (RDBMS) and MapReduce. The debate on \r\nwhich paradigm is superior to the other has lasted for several years, \r\nwhich led to a widely accepted view that there are advantages to both \r\nparadigms in different aspects. It was once believed that RDBMS can \r\ndeliver a better performance while MapReduce can scale out more easily due \r\nto its emphasis on fault tolerance design. However, recent works from both \r\nsides demonstrate that techniques used in one paradigm can be incorporated \r\ninto another to fix the deficiencies. In context of our research, we use \r\nHadoop, an open-source implementation of MapReduce and related components, \r\nto perform spatio-temporal data analytics. The main consideration is that \r\nHadoop provides us with low-level application programming interface (API) \r\nwhich is more flexible for implementing complex data mining algorithms \r\nthan structured query language (SQL) supported by RDBMS.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we first describe the design and implementation of CloST, \r\na scalable big spatio-temporal data storage system to support data \r\nanalytics using Hadoop. The main objective of CloST is to avoid scan the \r\nwhole dataset when a spatio-temporal range is given. To this end, we \r\npropose a novel data model which has special treatments on three core \r\nattributes including an object id, a location and a time. Based on this \r\ndata model, CloST hierarchically partitions data using all core attributes \r\nwhich enables efficient parallel processing of spatio-temporal range \r\nscans. According to the data characteristics, we devise a compact storage \r\nstructure which reduces the storage size by an order of magnitude. In \r\naddition, we proposes scalable bulk loading algorithms capable of \r\nincrementally adding new data into the system. Then we address the problem \r\nof parallel creation of secondary indexes in CloST. Particularly, we \r\npresent the design of a general framework for parallel R-tree packing \r\nusing Hadoop. This framework sequentially packs each R-tree level from \r\nbottom up. For lower levels that have a large number of rectangles, we \r\npropose a partition-based algorithm for parallel packing. We also discuss \r\ntwo spatial partitioning methods that can efficiently handle heavily \r\nskewed datasets.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the performance, we conduct extensive experiments using large \r\nreal datasets. The size of the datasets is up to 200GB and the number of \r\nspatial objects is up to 2 billion. The results show that CloST has fast \r\ndata loading speed, high scalability in query processing, high data \r\ncompression ratio, and desirable performance in building very large \r\nsecondary spatial indexes (R-trees).\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 29 November 2012\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t12:30pm \u2013 2:30pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3588\r\n \t\t\tLifts 27/28\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Zongjin Li (CIVL)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Lionel Ni (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tProf. Qiong Luo\r\n \t\t\tProf. Furong Gao (CBME)\r\n                         Prof. Qing Li (Comp.

They carry \r\nheterogeneous traffic in diverse environments, and usually involve \r\nmultiple self-interested entities. There are often conflicting goals among \r\nthe regulators, commercial operators and end users. To better build, \r\nunderstand, maintain, optimize, and upgrade such large distributed \r\nnetworks, it is important to design economic mechanisms as well as \r\ntechnologies. Past history has shown that sound technologies based on pure \r\nengineering considerations can fail to get adopted. Now the wireless \r\nnetworks are also at the cutting edge of their evolution, where dynamic \r\nspectrum accessing and cognitive radio technologies bring economics and \r\nincentive issues to the fore. There are opportunities to build economic \r\nincentives into the network architecture and protocols under development, \r\nand avoid the many problems that have arisen on the previous network \r\nsystem design due to their lack thereof. We discuss four typical scenarios \r\nin wireless network scenarios. The first one is about the cooperation \r\nscheme design for wireless service providers. We show that opportunities \r\nthat they can cooperate widely exist and through cooperation they address \r\nthe shortage of spectrum resource easily and economical efficiently. Then \r\nwe study the deployment and management problems in Macro-femto \r\nheterogeneous networks from business models and technical solutions \r\naspects. We classify the models into three categories: joint-deployment, \r\nWSP-deployment, and user-deployment. Their unique characteristics, \r\ncorresponding challenges and potential solutions are further explored to \r\nprovide a deeper insight from the systematic point of view. We also \r\npresent a scheme on the WSPs revenue maximization under the WSP-deployment \r\ncase. In the third work, we propose a cooperation framework for a mobile \r\noperator and a fixed-line operator. Through combining their fixed-line \r\ninfrastructures and spectrum resources, femtocells can be deployed and \r\nmanaged. We consider both the technical and economical factors. A unique \r\nclosed-form equilibrium is derived by Nash bargaining model, which is fair \r\nand efficient and thus amenable to the operators.

As an important instrument for diagnosing CVD, \nelectrocardiography (ECG) is used to extract useful information about the \nfunctioning status of the heart. To help clinicians better utilize the ECG \ndata, various systems have been proposed in last decades. One of the key \nissues in these system is the analysis of ECG data. In this domain, \ncluster analysis is a commonly applied approach to gain an overview of the \ndata, detect outliers or pre-process before further analysis. In recent \nyears, to provide better medical care for CVD patients, the new-generation \ncardiac telehealth system, which could monitor patients' ECG in a \nreal-time manner, has draw a great attention from both academia and \nindustry. In these systems, the collected ECG data is transmitted to a \nremote server and analysed in a real-time manner. However, the extremely \nlarge volume and high update rate of data in these telehealth systems have \nmade cluster analysis a challenging work. In this paper, we design and \nimplement a novel parallel system for clustering massive ECG stream data \nbased on the MapReduce framework. In our approach, a global optimum of \nclustering is achieved by merging and splitting clusters dynamically. \nMeanwhile, a good performance is gained by distributing computation over \nmultiple computing nodes.

In this work, we first studied the wireless signal propagation \nmodel by considering human activities influence.\n\nWe then propose a novel and truly unobtrusive detection method based on \nthe advanced wireless technologies, which we call as WiFall. WiFall \nemploys the variance pattern of Channel State Information (CSI) as the \nindicator of human activities. As CSI is readily available in prevalent \nin-use wireless infrastructures, WiFall withdraws the need for hard-ware \nmodification, environmental setup and worn or taken devices. The proposed \nsystem mainly consists of two parts: local outlier detection and activity \nclassification. The local outlier detection finds abnormal signal patterns \nwhich can eliminate stable and walk patterns. Activity classification \nalgorithm distinguishes fall from sit.

Mining or analyzing these kinds of data can shed \nlight into some very interesting applications such as extracting \npopulation's mobility pattern from mobile data, detecting anomalies from \nvehicle GPS data, monitoring traffic and quickly responding to events by \nmining historical trajectory data, and analyzing peoples' spatio-temporal \nbehaviors with social and commercial values from their social check-in \ndata. The hidden spatial-temporal patterns in these data can convey useful \nknowledge, which contributes to the decision-making and problem solving, \nand have high social and commercial values. However, analysis of a \ntremendous amount of spatial-temporal data is a very challenging task. \nThese data are usually noisy, sparse or incomplete, high dimensional, and \ncontain both spatial and temporal attributes. Thus a fast and intuitive \nway to understand and compare these characteristics is indispensable. How \nto clearly summary and explore these complex features in data becomes an \nimportant problem. It is essential to present the data features in its \noriginal structure to prevent information loss and facilitate the analysis \nand at the same time provide users with some approaches to characterize \nunique patterns, compare different combinations of features, and quickly \nsearch anomalies.\n\nVisual analytics has emerged as a very active research field and can be of \ngreat value for multiple dimensions, spatio-temporal attributes, and \nheterogeneous structures and also provide rich interactions, allowing \nusers to explore the data and improve mining processes and results with \ntheir domain knowledge. It turns complex and abstract data such as mobile \ndata, GPS data, historical trajectory, and social check-ins into visual \nrepresentations in intuitive ways with rich context over multiple \ndimensions, and then users can exploit interactive computer graphics \ntechniques and human visual capabilities to gain insight into the data. It \nis essential to keep human in the analysis loop to exploit the tremendous \npattern-recognition capability of the human visual system. And the \nanalyst's sense of the space and time, the knowledge of space/time's \ninherent properties and relationships, and space/time-related experiences, \nare hard to convey to machines. Targeting on the visual summarization and \nanalysis in spatial-temporal patterns in big data, in this thesis, we \npropose a set of visual summarization approaches on multi-dimensional \nspatio-temporal data, which cover different aspects of data visual \nanalysis issues.\n\n\u2022\tWe propose a visual analytic approach, which integrated many \nwell-established visualization techniques such as parallel coordinates and \npixel-based representations to characterize data's mobility-related \nfeatures and summarize user groups inferred from the results.\n\n\u2022\tWe develop a novel visualization method, Voronoi-diagram-based \nvisual design to reveal the unique features related to flow in the data. \nThis visualization method can better reveal the direction information when \ncomparing two adjacent flows of time-series data in a graph.\n\n\u2022\tWe propose a new visual aided mining approach, Visual \nFingerprinting (VF) for extremely large-scale spatio-temporal feature \nextraction and analysis. The approach integrated important statistical and \nhistorical information and can be conveniently embedded into urban maps. \nThe sophisticated design of the visualization can better reveal frequent \nor periodic patterns for temporal attributes.\n\n\u2022\tWe develop an interactive visual analytics system, T-Watcher, for \nmonitoring and analyzing complex traffic situations in big cities via taxi \ntrajectory data. Several new integrated traffic fingerprinting designs \nhave been elaborated. We also designed a novel visual structure called \ncell-glyph to compare instantaneous situations with statistical \ninformation.  The system consists of three major modules (the region \nfingerprint, the road fingerprint, and the vehicle fingerprint) and users \nare able to utilize the carefully designed visual structures to monitor \nand inspect data interactively from three levels (region, road and vehicle \nviews) for traffic patterns analysis and abnormal behaviors detection.\n\n\u2022\tWe present a visual analytics system, Social Check-in \nFingerprinting (Sci-Fin), to facilitate the analysis and visualization of \nsocial check-in data. We focus on three major components of the check-in \ndata: location, activity, and user. Visual fingerprints for region, \nactivity, and user are designed to intuitively represent high-dimensional, \nspatio-temporal attributes related to these components. Some well \nestablished visualizations like WorldMapper and Voronoi Treemap are \nintegrated into our glyph-like designs. The visual fingerprint designs \nallow easy comparison of different check-in locations, different \nactivities and user groups, which means they can be conveniently overlaid \ninto maps and embedded into graphs and charts.\n\n\u2022\tFinally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our \nmethods by conducting case studies on real datasets including mobile phone \ndata, taxi GPS data, and social check-in data.

Using modules in \nsoftware development enables the same functionality to be reused in other \nsystems, hence reducing the amount of duplicate code. While many traditional \nprogramming languages such as Python and Perl support the use of module system, \nJavaScript does not have a language-level module system. The JavaScript \ncommunity recommends the module pattern using function-local namespaces to \nsimulate modules. However, the single global namespace in JavaScript makes it \nhard to avoid name conflicts between modules. The introduction of the next \nversion of ECMAScript, known as ECMAScript Harmony, brings native support of \nmodule system in JavaScript. In our previous work, we conducted an empirical \nstudy of code clones in JavaScript applications. We found that the amount of \nconsistent clones is significant and most of them are easily refactorable. This \nfinding suggests the need of module systems for JavaScript applications.\n\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to extract modules in JavaScript \napplications automatically by leveraging code clone analysis. We first identify \nreusable functions from JavaScript applications and dispatch them into groups. \nWe then leverage clone detection and removal techniques to merge code clones in \neach group. After that, we apply transformation rules based on the ECMAScript \nHarmony specification to rewrite each group of functions with the module \nsyntax. We then apply topic modeling to identify the optimal name of each \nmodule. We evaluated our approach on 29 JavaScript web pages and 27 JavaScript \nstandalone projects in terms of the software quality and developers' \nacceptability. We found that our approach helps to improve the \nunderstandability of the extracted modules by at most 20% and complexity by at \nmost 35%, and developers have higher acceptability in the modules extracted by \nthe proposed approach.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 15 August 2013\n\nTime:\t\t\t3:00pm \u2013 5:00pm\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3416\n \t\t\tLifts 17/18\n\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Sunghun Kim (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung (Chairperson)\n \t\t\tDr. Charles Zhang\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Automatic Module Extraction in JavaScript Applications by Leveraging Code Clone Analysis"], "lenArticle": 363},

Along with the exponential growth \r\nof various data becoming available, NoSQL data storage has risen as the \r\nprevailing solution for Big Data. Without the strong support of heavy \r\nindex, join becomes even more crucial and challenging for querying against \r\nor mining from massive data. There have been intensive studies over \r\ndifferent types of join operations over distributed data, e.g. similarity \r\njoin, set join, fuzzy join and etc., all of which focus on efficient join \r\nquery evaluation by exploring the massive parallelism promised by the \r\nMapReduce computing framework on the Cloud platform. However, surprisingly \r\nmost of existing works rarely study the multi-way join problem, which is \r\nsummarized as the ``complex join'' in this thesis. The substantial \r\nchallenge of ``complex join'' lies in, given a number of processing units, \r\nmapping a multi-way join query to a number of parallel tasks and having \r\nthem executed in a well scheduled sequence, such that the total processing \r\ntime span is minimized. As a matter of fact, multi-way join is widely \r\nadopted many real world applications. In this thesis, we demonstrate how \r\nour ``complex join'' solution can be well applied to the query processing \r\nover RDF data. To summarize, our study covers three following aspects:\r\n\r\n1) We propose a cost model based RDF join processing solution using \r\nMapReduce and general purposed optimization strategy;\r\n\r\n2) We study the problem of efficient processing of multi-way Theta-join \r\nqueries using MapReduce from a cost-effective perspective;\r\n\r\n3) We propose  an novel representation of RDF data on Cloud platforms, \r\nbased on which we propose an I/O efficient strategy to evaluate SPARQL \r\nqueries as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the efficiency and \r\neffectiveness of our proposed solutions for multi-way join processing on \r\nthe Cloud. At the meanwhile, we report our preliminary work and discuss \r\nthe future research plans including several interesting directions on the \r\ncomplex join processing on the Cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Tuesday, 8 January 2013\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:30pm - 4:30pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Lei Chen (Supervisor)\r\n                         Dr. Raymond Wong (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Kai Chen\r\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Efficient Processing of Complex Join Queries on the Cloud"], "lenArticle": 382},

Collision happens when two or \r\nmore packets overlap with each other at receiver side and none of them can \r\nbe received correctly. Collision increases packet delivery delay and \r\ndecreases network throughput because of retransmissions. To tackle \r\ncollision, researchers propose abundant protocols in Medium Access Control \r\n(MAC) layer. The essential idea behind these protocols is to properly \r\ncoordinate multiple senders to access a shared channel and avoid the case \r\nwhen there are two or more senders accessing a shared channel \r\nsimultaneously. There are two ways to coordinate multiple senders. CSMA, \r\nfor example, is a contention based MAC layer protocol while TDMA, on the \r\nother hand is a schedule based protocol. In recent years, an increasing \r\nnumber of protocols are invented to resolve or even utilize collision from \r\nthe view of PHY layer. As PHY layer provides more information and \r\ndemonstrates useful properties, e.g. power indicator like RSSI, the effect \r\nof capture and constructive interference, researchers approach to the \r\nproblem of collision in wireless network from a new way. For example, pure \r\ncollision avoidance is thought to be superficial and too general, and some \r\nprotocols try to tolerate the existence of collision while guarantee the \r\nperformance of network. Some protocols walk even farther- they treat \r\ncollision as a something good and make use of it.\r\n\r\nThis survey reviews diverse collision resolution protocols. The logical \r\nroadmap of this survey is the manner in which protocols treat collision. \r\nFirstly, traditional collision avoidance based MAC layer protocols are \r\npresented Wireless Senor Networks (WSNs). Secondly, based on the important \r\nproperty, e.g. capture and constructive interference exhibited in PHY \r\nlayer, protocols that utilize these properties are analyzed and this \r\nsurvey demonstrates how these protocols could tolerate collision with \r\nlittle performance degradation. Thirdly, this survey demonstrates several \r\nprotocols that can cancel collision. Last but not least, this survey \r\npresents some protocols and describe the details of how to make use of \r\ncollision to help improve network performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Wednesday, 9 January 2013\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Yunhao Liu (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi (Supervisor)\r\n                         Dr. Gary Chan (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Go Passive to Active- A Survey on Collision Resolution Mechanism in Wireless Sensor Networks"], "lenArticle": 394},

An RFID reader can remotely collect +tag IDs for tag \r\nidentification. There are two major fundamental problems in RFID systems, \r\nnamely how to efficiently identify the tag IDs and how to rapidly count the \r\nnumber of tags especially in a large scale RFID system. The standard MAC-layer \r\ntag identification protocol is based on framed slotted ALOHA (FSA), which is \r\ninefficient in essence. FSA can achieve a maximum identification efficiency of \r\n1/e = 36.8%. Specifically, a maximum of 36.8% of tags can be identified in one \r\nround of identification. To improve the identification efficiency of FSA, a \r\nnumber of approaches are proposed, either using MAC layer or physical layer \r\ntechniques. Counting the number of tags can be trivially accomplished by \r\nidentifying each of the tags. This approach, however, takes too long time \r\nespecially in large scale RFID systems. Rather than count precisely, we can \r\nderive an estimation of tag set cardinality using much quicker methods. The \r\nmajority of tag cardinality estimation schemes adopt statistical methods and \r\nusually several rounds of estimation are required to approximate the fixed \r\nprecision.\r\n\r\nIn this survey, we will review a series of tag identification and cardinality \r\nestimation methods primarily in single-reader-multi-tag scenario.The \r\nidentification and estimation efficiency of different protocols will also be \r\npresented.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 9 January 2013\r\n\r\nTime:                   4:00pm - 6:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Yunhao Liu (Supervisor)\r\n                         Dr. Ke Yi (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. James Kwok (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Tag Identification and Estimation in RFID Systems"], "lenArticle": 298},

During the lifetime, it is \r\nnecessary to fix bugs, reconfigure system parameters, and upgrade the \r\nsoftware in order to achieve reliable system performance. However, \r\nmanually collecting all nodes back and reconfiguring through serial \r\nconnections with computer is infeasible since it is labor-intensive and \r\nsometime even impossible because of the harsh deploying environment. \r\nHence, data dissemination over multi-hop is desired to facilitate such \r\ntasks.\r\n\r\nThis survey discusses the challenges and requirements of data \r\ndissemination in WSNs, reviews existing works, introduces some relevant \r\ntechniques, presents the evaluation metrics and comparisons of the \r\nperformance of state-of-the-art works, and finally suggests the further \r\ndirections in data dissemination studies.

Besides, new techniques such as \r\nConstructive Interference (CI) have the chance to change the working \r\nframework of data dissemination.

Among all \r\nextensive studies on minimizing power consumption of sensor nodes, \r\nneighbor discovery is one of the fundamental components focusing on \r\ncommunication and access in ad hoc networks. Because of the energy \r\nconstraint, sensor nodes usually work on a low duty cycle, notably by \r\nturning off radio for a large proportion of time. However, the basic \r\nrequirement of communication between two nodes is that they need to be \r\nactive (i.e., radio on) at the same time. The crux of neighbor discovery \r\nis not only to ensure discovery, but discover neighbors as soon as \r\npossible (low latency) while saving energy as much as possible (low duty \r\ncycle).\r\n\r\nThis work surveys the literature of neighbor discovery protocols (NDPs). \r\nIn general, they can be roughly classified into four classes: the Birthday \r\nprotocols, over-half occupation, rotation-resistant intersection, and \r\ncoprime methods. The Birthday protocols act as representatives of NDPs \r\nusing probabilistic approaches in which a node decides to listen, \r\ntransmit, and sleep with probabilities. The original idea of over-half \r\noccupation is to be active on at least half of each cycle/round, though \r\nrefinement has been proposed to decrease its high duty cycle. Methods of \r\nrotation-resistant intersection formulate the problem of discovery using \r\ncombinatorial characteristics of time slots. Neighbor discovery is \r\nguaranteed with a worst-case bound thanks to the Chinese Remainder \r\nTheorem. We present and compare several representative protocols in these \r\nfour classes, and point out future directions of NDPs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Thursday, 10 January 2013\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Yunhao Liu (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo (Supervisor)\r\n                         Dr. Gary Chan (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Kai Chen\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["A Survey on Neighbor Discovery in Wireless Sensor Networks"], "lenArticle": 331},

In particular, the data center network \n(DCN) needs to be agile and reconfigurable in order to respond quickly to \never changing application demands and service requirements. Significant \nresearch work has been done on designing the data center network \ntopologies in order to improve the performance of data centers.\n\nIn this thesis, we first present a abstract survey of DCN designs and \ntopologies that have published recently. We start with a discussion on \nvarious representative data center network topologies, and compare them \nwith respect to several properties in order to highlight their advantages \nand disadvantages. A good understanding of the state-of-the-art in DCN \nwould enable the design of future architectures in order to improve \nperformance and dependability of data centers.\n\nWith the plethora of DCN topologies that have been proposed in the \nliterature, there is a sore need for a standardized method for evaluating \nand comparing various alternate DCN architectures. Considering these \nneeds, we designed DCNSim, a general purpose DCN simulator that supports \nmost well-known DCN topologies proposed in the literature. Our simulator \ncan generate various metrics for the topologies. The modular and flexible \narchitecture of the simulator permits easy extension to support any future \nproposed topologies and compute new metrics.\n\nWith the support of DCNSim, we present evaluations of the fault-tolerance \ncharacteristics of several important DCN topologies. These enable us to \npresent an objective comparison of the topologies under faulty conditions. \nBesides individual failures, we introduce the idea of fault regions to \nstudy associated failures in DCNs. Evaluations regarding fault regions \ngive us a more comprehensive view on the performance of DCN topologies.\n\nOptical DCNs are more complex than the architectures discussed above \nbecause they do not have fixed topology. However, they are becoming \nincreasingly popular for their technological advantages including \nflexibility and high bandwidth. The existing algorithm applied in \nliterature cannot fully utilize such model and its flexibility. Besides, \nreconfiguring optical DCN topology according to the changing traffic is a \nproblem that has never been well researched.

Thus, it is difficult to monitor the operation of the sensor \r\nnodes within a WSN. In some applications, the whole system consists of \r\nthousands of sensor nodes. How to guarantee the performance of such \r\nsystems would be a great challenge. One method to avoid the problem raised \r\nin operating such large scale system is to conduct extensive testing by an \r\nexperiment tool in the real environment. If the developer could obtain \r\nenergy consumption of the sensor nodes and topology info of the whole \r\nsensor system, the performance of the large scale WSN system can be fully \r\nmonitored.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose an experiment and monitoring tool for WSN where \r\nthe internal data and energy consumption of sensor nodes can be caught, \r\nand the topology and routing paths of the whole network can be shown.

They outperform \r\nmagnetic disks on access speed, bandwidth, shock resistance, and power \r\nefficiency. As their capacity increases and prices decrease, flash disks are \r\nconsidered for the storage of database systems. Due to the differences in flash \r\nSSDs and magnetic disks, traditional data management techniques designed for \r\nmagnetic disks need to be re-examined for flash disks. In particular, the flash \r\nmemory used in flash disks has an asymmetry between read and write speeds, \r\nwhere reads, no matter random or sequential, are much faster than writes.\r\n\r\nThis thesis studies the performance of transactional workloads on flash disks \r\nand designs efficient storage schemes for them. Specifically, we study the \r\nperformance of the TPC-C workload on flash SSDs. Overall, the flash SSDs \r\noutperform the magnetic disk by up to an order of magnitude. Moreover, the I/O \r\nperformance of the SSDs is dominated by random writes, whereas that of the \r\nmagnetic disk by random reads. Additionally, both minimising logging and \r\nadopting MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) than 2PL (Two-Phase Locking) \r\nhelps improve the performance on flash SSDs.\r\n\r\nObserving the dominance of random writes in flash SSDs under TPC-C workloads, \r\nwe propose a new database storage layout, called Partitioned Logging (PTL). In \r\nPTL, we replace data writes with logging to eliminate random page writes, and \r\nput data and logs into separate blocks. Moreover, we group data blocks into \r\npartitions so that updates on each partition are appended as log entries to one \r\nlog block. This way, we can tune the partition size to balance the read and \r\nwrite performance based on the hardware and workload characteristics. The \r\nresults show a considerable improvement over both the traditional storage and a \r\nleading flash-based database storage scheme.\r\n\r\nFinally, for transactional workloads on key-value stores, we propose FlashTKV, \r\nwhich adopts a purely sequential storage format where all the data and \r\ntransactional information are log records. Furthermore, we support MVCC on this \r\nsequential storage efficiently. Our initial results show that FlashTKV improves \r\nthe transaction throughput by 70% over two well-known KV-stores under TPC-C \r\nworkloads on flash SSDs.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Flash SSDs, asymmetric I/O, online transaction processing (OLTP), \r\nTPC-C, database storage, log-structured, Key-Value store.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Wednesday, 30 January 2013\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Qiong Luo (Supervisor)\r\n                        \tProf. Dik-Lun Lee (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Frederick Lochovsky\r\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Efficient Transactional Database Storage Management on Flash Solid State Drives"], "lenArticle": 427},

Traditionally, data structures \r\nare designed and analyzed in the RAM model, where each memory cell can be \r\naccessed with unit cost. This assumption, however, is unrealistic for modeling \r\nmodern memory hierarchies which consist of many levels of memories and caches \r\nwith different sizes and access costs. As a consequence, a number of more \r\nelaborate models were introduced. Among them the most successful ones are the \r\nI/O model and the cache-oblivious model. In recent years, designing data \r\nstructures that are I/O-efficient or cache-oblivious has become an active \r\ndirection in both the theory and database communities.\r\n\r\nThis proposal starts by considering the dictionary problem, one of the most \r\nbasic data structure problems, in which we want to store and access a set of \r\n(key, data) pairs. Hash tables are the most efficient and the most fundamental \r\ndata structure for implementing a dictionary. In this proposal we study hash \r\ntables in both the I/O model and the cache- oblivious\u00a0model. We first show an \r\ninherent query-insertion tradeoff of hashing in the I/O model, which implies \r\nthat the buffering technique is essentially useless for hash tables.

The implementations of these new MEPs use the MIME \r\nMultipart/Related structure and MTOM packaging when transferring the multimedia \r\npackets as SOAP messages. In order to reduce the transfer overhead introduced \r\nby the packaging method, this thesis examines the use of binary XML in \r\ncompressing the SOAP messages as well as for packaging the binary packet data. \r\nExperiments show that the proposed framework can achieve a performance \r\ncomparable to a simple HTTP multimedia streaming method.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Tuesday, 8 November 2011\r\n\r\nTime:                   4:00pm - 6:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 5565\r\n                         lifts 27/28\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. David Rossiter (Supervisor)\r\n                         Prof. Andrew Horner (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung\r\n \t\t\tDr. Wilfred Ng\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["A Web Services Framework Supporting Multimedia Streaming"], "lenArticle": 228},

As the most informative and \r\nreliable source of user action, click is believed to be the most important \r\nuser activity in the data. Understanding the motivation behind a click or \r\nthe decision making process to trigger it becomes the key to uncover the \r\nmyth encoded in the data.\r\n\r\nYet, user click behaviour is complex, varying with users and implicit \r\nunder various contexts. This poses challenges to characterize a click \r\ncomprehensively. Many recent research works have attempted to model user \r\nclick behaviour in a structural manner and positioned it as a click model \r\nproblem, with the intention to better exploit user click behaviour so as \r\nto predict user click or estimate a user-perceived relevance for each \r\nquery-document pair.\r\n\r\nDespite of their success, most existing click models treat the modelled \r\nobjects, such as queries, users, sessions, in isolation, disregarding \r\ntheir relationships. This may bring a simplification to the model but \r\nsimultaneously sacrifices much valuable information, and hence interpret \r\nuser click data in an inaccurate or biased way. This thesis proposal puts \r\nforward a family of algorithms to address these limitations. Our object is \r\nto characterize multiple associations among objects as well as design \r\nnovel collective click models, where multiple modelled objects and their \r\nrelationships are involved and associated together.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm family will depict the associations from three facets: \r\nregion-based, query-based and user-based associations. Region-based models \r\nfocus on the interplaying between organic search and sponsored search, so \r\nthat it can depict user behaviour in the whole page thoroughly. \r\nQuery-based models first collectively investigate the multiple queries \r\nwith their corresponding clicks in a same session by designing a \r\nsession-based click model. Then, it scrutinizes and uses the rich \r\ninformation in the high-frequent queries to alleviate the sparseness of \r\nlong-tailed queries. User-based models characterize the user-centric click \r\nbehaviour to design a personalized click model to entertain each \r\nindividual user. These user-based models can also be tailored to better \r\nsolve the sparseness challenges in the long-tailed queries. Finally, an \r\nongoing feasibility study with extensive investigations showcases the \r\npracticality of the associative click models and future works are proposed \r\nto solve the problem to a next level.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Friday, 25 November 2011\r\n\r\nTime:                   1:00pm - 3:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3304\r\n                         lifts 17/18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Qiang Yang (Supervisor)\r\n                         Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dik-Lun Lee\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["A Family of Algorithms to Characterize Association in Click Model for Web Search"], "lenArticle": 453},

Such \r\nanalysis can help people understand the user behavior, network structures \r\nand information flow. It can also promote commercial applications, ranging \r\nfrom recommendation, on-line advertisement to social marketing. The major \r\ndifference between social and traditional networks is that social networks \r\nare usually composite, where people may exist in multiple social networks. \r\nSuch a property leads to two research issues. The first one is that each \r\nuser in social networks may share different relationships with their \r\nneighbors, which require researchers to use multi-relational knowledge to \r\nperform comprehensive network analysis while taking into account their \r\ndifferent contextual information. Secondly, the composite property sheds \r\nlight on solving the ``sparsity'' problem in social networks, by \r\nconsidering the shared nodes among networks as the bridge and exploiting \r\ncross-network knowledge transfer.

As the technology and \r\napplication of recommendation is rapidly evolving in these years, traditional \r\ncollaborative filtering algorithms such as nearest neighbor or matrix \r\nfactorization have fallen short in coping with several emerging but critical \r\nissues in modern systems. Firstly, ranking items, especially identifying a few \r\nmost interesting items out of a huge pool, has become the core task in most \r\napplication scenarios. However, traditional algorithms focus on doing \r\nregression on the observed user ratings (i.e., explicit user feedback), which \r\nis a detour towards the end goal of ranking. In this work, we propose a new \r\nframework for directly solving the personalized ranking problem by representing \r\nuser feedback using pairwise preference based representation. We show that the \r\nranking model provides a unified framework for handling both explicit feedback \r\n(e.g., ratings) and implicit feedback (e.g., clicks, purchases) as well as \r\ncombination of heterogeneous user feedback, which is a setting that commonly \r\narises in modern applications. Secondly, we extend the proposed ranking model \r\nto also consider the temporal context, as time awareness is becoming an \r\nincreasingly important feature in real world applications, which often need to \r\ncope rich temporal dynamics and provide context aware recommendations. Finally, \r\nwe further the extend the framework to also consider relational information \r\nabout users and/or items. In particular, we consider the social relations among \r\nusers the taxonomical relations between items, which are commonly found in real \r\nworld systems. Our results demonstrate that utilizing these additional \r\nknowledge could greatly improve upon pure CF algorithms under data sparsity \r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 7 December 2011\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t1:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3402\r\n \t\t\tLifts 17/18\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Howard Luong (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Qiang Yang (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dik-Lun Lee\r\n \t\t\tProf. Wilfred Ng\r\n \t\t\tProf. Kwok-Yip Szeto (PHYS)\r\n                      \tProf. Qing Li (Comp.

It is \r\ngaining increasing popularity in diverse application domains, ranging from \r\nWeb search to collaborative filtering. One particular challenge in the \r\napplication of transfer learning is the need to identify one or more \r\nproper source domains from where knowledge can be transferred. In the \r\npast, the source domains are often specified by human experts, which has \r\nbecome a major impediment to the application of transfer learning in the \r\nreal world. In this proposal, we propose a novel transfer learning \r\nframework that requires no specific source data be given; instead, the \r\nsystem can find a set of appropriate subsets to use as the auxiliary data \r\nfor transfer learning. It does this by searching from some extremely large \r\ncollection on the world wide web for data that can be beneficial to a \r\ngiven target learning task.\r\n\r\nIn our approach, known as source-free transfer learning (SFTL), we are \r\ngiven a target task set to learn, where the training data may have an \r\ninsufficient amount of labeled data only. To build a model, SFTL turns to \r\na series of very large, open information sources, such as the Web, for \r\nhelp, by identifying a portion of the knowledge as the potential source \r\ndata. In our preliminary feasibility study on text classification, we have \r\ntested an idea of selecting the source data from the Wikipedia to assist \r\nseveral text categorization tasks. When we open up to Web scale, we face \r\nseveral new problems. First, since the Web scale online knowledge source \r\nis huge, it is a challenge to automatically generate task related queries \r\nto find the ``right'' source data. Second, once the potentially diverse \r\nsource data are found, it is also an open issue how to unify these \r\nheterogeneous data sources to enable effective transfer learning for the \r\nspecific target data. We also need to design a mechanism to acquire the \r\nright distance measures for these data and models. Third, we need \r\ndifferent selection strategies to integrate the diverse data as the \r\npotential source data for solving the target learning problem, in an \r\neffective and efficient manner, particularly as these collections can be \r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nCompared to previous works on transfer learning, the SFTL framework has a \r\nmajor advantage from its source-free nature; users of a learning task no \r\nlonger need to find the necessary source data to start learning. Another \r\nadvantage is scalability; unlike many previous transfer learning \r\napproaches, which are difficult to scale up to the WWW scale knowledge \r\ntransfer, our approach would be highly scalable both for the training and \r\nthe prediction stage. We will use two real-world learning tasks, i.e., \r\nclassification and link prediction, to carry out this research. We will \r\ndemonstrate how our SFTL framework can be instantiated for these two \r\ndifferent learning problems. The proposal will discuss some difficulties \r\nwhich have been tackled by related works and our preliminary feasibility \r\nstudy, and then point out some ongoing research issues for extensive \r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Thursday, 15 December 2011\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3311\r\n                         lifts 17/18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Qiang Yang (Supervisor)\r\n                         Dr. Huamin Qu (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung\r\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Source-Free Transfer Learning with Web 2.0"], "lenArticle": 552},

These methods\r\nachieve very fast search speed by indexing data with binary codes.\r\nAlthough lots of hash functions for various similarity metrics have\r\nbeen proposed, they are argued to generate very long codes due to\r\ntheir data independence nature. In recent years, machine learning\r\ntechniques have been applied to learn hash functions from data,\r\nforming a new research topic called hash function learning. In this\r\nproposal, we study two important issues in hash function learning. On\r\none hand, existing supervised or semi-supervised hash function\r\nlearning methods, which learn hash functions from labeled data, can be\r\nregarded to be passive because they assume that the labeled data are\r\nprovided in advance. Given that the data labeling process can be very\r\ncostly in practice and the contribution of labeled data to hash\r\nfunction learning can be quite different, it may be more cost\r\neffective for the hash function learning methods to select labeled\r\ndata from which to learn. To this end, we propose a novel framework,\r\ntermed active hashing, to actively select the most informative data to\r\nlabel for hash function learning. Under the framework, we develop one\r\nsimple method which queries labels of data that current hash functions\r\nare most uncertain on. Experiments conducted on two real data sets\r\nshow obvious improvement of our active hashing algorithm over previous\r\npassive hashing methods. On the other hand, most of existing hash\r\nfunction learning methods only work on uni-modal data, which are\r\nobviously not the case in many applications, e.g., multimedia\r\nretrieval and cross-lingual document analysis. To apply hashing\r\nfunction learning to multimodal data, we develop three methods under\r\nthe framework of multimodal hashing which hashes data points of\r\nmultiple modalities into one common Hamming space. For paired data,\r\nthe first method is based on spectral analysis of multimodal data\r\ncorrelations. For general data, we pro- pose one non-probabilistic\r\nmodel which uses normalized Hamming distance to approximate the\r\ndistance in original input space, and one probabilistic model that can\r\ngenerate intra-modal and inter-modal similarities based on hash codes.\r\nThe effectiveness of our models is validated through preliminary\r\ncomparative study. The proposal will also discuss some ongoing\r\nresearch issues currently under investigation and set up a timetable\r\nfor the thesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Friday, 16 December 2011\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3304\r\n                         lifts 17/18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung (Supervisor)\r\n                         Prof. Qiang Yang (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. James Kwok\r\n \t\t\tProf. Nevin Zhang\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["SOME RESEARCH ISSUES IN HASH FUNCTION LEARNING"], "lenArticle": 442},

However, we may suffer from private information disclosure when \r\nthe learning results are released to the public.

Specifically, in this survey, we focus on differentially \r\nprivate learning, including the learning algorithms that satisfy the \r\nnotion of differential privacy, which is regarded as the gold standard in \r\nthe privacy preserving community.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental objective of differentially private learning is to \r\ntradeoff between privacy and utility.

The IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) have become \r\nincreasingly popular due to the recent availability of affordable devices \r\nproviding multiple and high rate capabilities. Optimizing the performance of \r\nwireless networks for emerging network applications is an important and a \r\nhighly challenging issue.\r\n\r\nIn the next generation WLAN standards like IEEE 802.11ac and 802.11ad, new PHY \r\nand MAC layer enhancements have been introduced. These improvements have given \r\nbirth to wide bandwidth channels and very high transmission rates (>1Gbps) to \r\nkeep up with current and upcoming multimedia applications. However, the major \r\nreason for the inefficiency of different WLANs is that the current MAC layer \r\nrandomly allocates the entire channel to only one user as a single resource. \r\nThus, we argue that a better way to improve WLAN performance is to effectively \r\nreduce the channel width and create different sized channels (sub-channels), \r\nand serve several users simultaneously. In Addition, the Quality of Service \r\n(QoS) is very important for the Very High Throughput WLANs. Scheduling access \r\nfor flows in a non-interfering manner to avoid packet loss and adapt rates to \r\nchanging channel conditions are important aspects of QoS in wireless networks. \r\nThe goal of the rate adaptation scheme is to select the best set of \r\ntransmission parameters for a given user considering its channel conditions. \r\nSimilar to that goal, sub-channels scheduling access can be seen as selecting \r\nthe best set of users to allocate subcarriers according to their channel state \r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nData traffic has diverse characteristics and thus different transmission \r\nrequirements. In particular, an advanced version of Multimedia-MAC should exist \r\nto dynamically adjust the bandwidth allocation according to the instant status \r\nof traffic load so that both network channel utilization and QoS for different \r\ntypes of traffic streams will be enhanced dramatically. In this survey, our \r\nplan is to design a dynamic sub-channel assignment method based on traffic \r\npriority, in order to maximize throughput. Also, we propose to profit from the \r\nsub-channels access approach and adapt the rate separately for each block of \r\nsubcarriers according to the channel variations, for more improvement. Thus, an \r\nefficient access scheduling and rate control schemes can effectively guarantee \r\nQoS and maximize the throughput. Our future objective is to develop an \r\nefficient packet scheduling model and rate adaptation scheme, and test their \r\nperformances with real hardware devices in the present and next generation of \r\nWLANs, by applying the simultaneous multi-user access approach.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Friday, 6 January 2012\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3494\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Mounir Hamdi (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala (Supervisor)\r\n                         Dr. Gary Chan (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Brahim Bensaou\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Sub-channels Access Scheduling and Rate Adaptation for Very High Throughput WLANs"], "lenArticle": 469},

With the advances of Service Oriented \r\nArchitecture (SOA) a component-based approach can be applied to multimedia \r\nsystem development. A complex and large scale multimedia system can be \r\nsplit into smaller and reusable components. These components can be \r\ncomposed in different ways so that the development of the multimedia \r\nsystem can be flexible and the resulting component-based system is more \r\nmaintainable, reliable and scalable than a monolithic system.\r\n\r\nOne of the common implementations of SOA is Web services. However the \r\ntransfer of streaming data, which is a major part of multimedia systems, \r\nis not well supported by current Web services standards. To reap the \r\nbenefits of the component-based approach for multimedia system \r\ndevelopment, this thesis proposes a novel multimedia streaming Web \r\nservices framework which includes multimedia streaming support in the Web \r\nservices domain. The proposed framework focuses on three issues: the \r\ndiscoverability of a multimedia Web service, the implementation of \r\nstreaming data transfer between two Web service endpoints and the \r\nefficiency of the streaming data transfer.\r\n\r\nFirst, the discoverability of a Web service relies on a standardized and \r\ndescriptive metadata for its content. The proposed framework provides a \r\nquery service so that the description of multimedia content input to and \r\noutput from a multimedia Web service can be published via an extension of \r\nWSDL. Second, the proposed framework implements the streaming data \r\ntransfer between two service endpoints using two new Message Exchange \r\nPatterns (MEPs) and their corresponding HTTP bindings. The implementations \r\nuse MIME and Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM) to \r\ntransfer streaming multimedia as a stream of SOAP messages. Third, to \r\nreduce the transfer overhead introduced by the packaging method, this \r\nthesis investigated extensively the application of various compression \r\nschemes to the SOAP messages as well as to the packaging of the binary \r\npacket data. Experiments show that the proposed framework, coupled with \r\nthe use of the binary XML encoding scheme, has a good performance for \r\nmultimedia streaming transfer between two service endpoints.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 6 January 2012\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Tie-Zheng Qian (MATH)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. David Rossiter (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung\r\n \t\t\tProf. Wilfred Ng\r\n \t\t\tProf. Richard So (IELM)\r\n                         Prof. Patrick Hung (Business & Inf.

This gives people a great opportunity \r\nto obtain useful information from these social network data. Meanwhile, \r\nthe information stored in these social networks are under high risk of \r\nattack by various malicious users, in other words, people's privacy could \r\nbe easily breached via some domain knowledge. Thus, for a service \r\nprovider, such as Facebook and Linkedin, how to publish a privacy \r\npreserving graph becomes an important problem. It is essential to protect \r\nusers' privacy and at the same time provide ``useful'' data. Targeting the \r\nprivacy preserving graph publication problem, in this thesis, we propose \r\ngraph publishing models, which cover different aspects of graph \r\npublication issues.\r\n\r\n1) We propose a novel privacy preserving graph construction technique \r\nbased on adding noise nodes. This new graph construction algorithm \r\nprovides privacy protection for the individuals in the graph and their \r\nattributes as well as maintaining good graph utility.\r\n\r\n2) We propose a general fine-grained adjusting framework to publish a \r\nprivacy protected and utility preserved graph. Using this framework, the \r\ndata publisher gets a trade-off between privacy and utility according to \r\nthe data publisher's customized preference. The protected privacy and \r\npreserved utilities can be quantified. We use protecting the privacy of a \r\nweighted graph as an example to demonstrate the implementation of this \r\nframework.\r\n\r\n3) We further propose a personalized protection framework for social \r\nnetworks, which publishes graphs with the consideration of users' \r\npersonalized privacy settings.\r\n\r\n4) After observing the lack of related work on the weighted graph model, \r\nwhich is general for online social network application, we propose graph \r\nprotection models which protect individuals when the weights on the \r\nrelationships are considered.\r\n\r\n5) To solve the privacy leakage when the algorithm which generates the \r\npublished graph is known by the attacker, we propose a new protecting \r\nmodel which protects both the sensitive labels and sensitive links in a \r\ngraph.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 10 January 2012\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Johnny Sin (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Lei Chen (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Cunsheng Ding\r\n \t\t\tProf. Ke Yi\r\n \t\t\tProf. Weichuan Yu (ECE)\r\n                       \tProf. Kian-Lee Tan (Comp.

Given two sets of \r\nobjects, we want to match the objects from one set with those from the \r\nother set according to some appropriate objectives.\r\n\r\nMany matching problems have been proposed in the literature.

Nevertheless, most of them are not efficient enough for \r\nlarge datasets. For instance, the lower bound of the time complexity for \r\nStable Marriage is quadratic and that for Optimal Matching Problem is even \r\nworse, cubic. Fortunately,as some researchers discovered,some of these \r\nperformance limitations do not occur any more when the matching problems \r\nare studied in the context of spatial databases.\r\n\r\nRecently, considerable research has been conducted on the matching \r\nproblems in the community of spatial databases.

Many \r\nworks have been proposed to facilitate this colorization process targeting \r\nat different types of input images. However, these methods require users \r\nto indicate regions by precise clicks or strokes, which is a tedious \r\nprocess and difficult to operate on touch devices due to the well-known \r\nfat finger problem. In this thesis, we propose a new tool which is able to \r\ndetermine meaningful regions when the user draws a rough stroke to \r\ncolorize an image. The input image is composed of well-defined closed \r\nregions, which can be a template image, or extracted from a cartoon or \r\nline drawing image by segmentation. The correlations between pairs of \r\nregions are pre-analyzed before editing. When a stroke is drawn, the \r\npossible intention of the user is estimated by grouping regions that share \r\ncommon properties. By matching the position and shape information between \r\ncandidate groups and the stroke, the candidate groups are ordered to \r\ncapture their possibilities to be the intended colorization regions. The \r\ngroup with the best score is returned as the default colorization result, \r\nand an ordered list of candidate groups is displayed for possible \r\nselection of alternative colorization results. Our tool allows regions \r\nthat share common properties to be colorized using a single stroke, drawn \r\nonly roughly, making our tool suitable for touch-based interfaces.

Traditionally, data \r\nstructures are designed and analyzed in the RAM model, where each memory \r\ncell can be accessed with unit cost. This assumption, however, is \r\nunrealistic for modeling modern memory hierarchies which consist of many \r\nlevels of memories and caches with different sizes and access costs. As a \r\nconsequence, a number of more elaborate models were introduced. Among them \r\nthe most successful ones are the I/O model and the cache-oblivious model. \r\nIn recent years, designing data structures that are I/O-efficient or \r\ncache-oblivious has become an active direction in both the theory and \r\ndatabase communities.\r\n\r\nThis thesis starts by considering the dictionary problem, one of the most \r\nbasic data structure problems, in which we want to store and access a set \r\nof (key, data) pairs. Hash tables are the most efficient and the most \r\nfundamental data structure for implementing a dictionary. In this thesis \r\nwe study hash tables in both the I/O model and the cache-oblivious model. \r\nWe first show an inherent query-insertion tradeoff of hashing in the I/O \r\nmodel, which implies that the buffering technique is essentially useless \r\nfor hash tables. In the cache-oblivious model, we build a hash table that \r\nachieves the same search cost as its cache-aware version does, for all \r\nblock sizes.\r\n\r\nThe second problem studied is another fundamental data structure problem, \r\npriority queues. The priority queue problem is well understood in the \r\ncomparison based I/O model, where its complexity is known to be the same \r\nas sorting. In this thesis, we establish their equivalence in the I/O \r\nmodel without any restrictions, by providing a reduction from priority \r\nqueues to sorting. Note that the other direction of the reduction is \r\ntrivial.\r\n\r\nThe third problem studied in this thesis is the summary query problem, \r\nwhich is a natural generalization of the range searching problem. Our goal \r\nis to design data structures that allow for extracting a statistical \r\nsummary of all the records in the query range.  The summaries we support \r\ninclude frequent items, quantiles, various sketches, and wavelets, all of \r\nwhich are of central importance in massive data analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 2 February 2012\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t1:30pm \u2013 3:30pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3402\r\n \t\t\tLifts 17/18\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Anaimalai MUTHUKRISHNAN (MARK)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Ke Yi (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Siu-Wing Cheng\r\n \t\t\tProf. Mordecai Golin\r\n \t\t\tProf. Xiangtong Qi (IELM)\r\n                      \tProf. Yitong Yin (Comp.

Although the \r\nduty-cycling technique turns out to notably increase the lifetime of \r\nsensor nodes, the network lifetime can still be largely limited due to the \r\nunevenly distributed network traffic load in many applications. In \r\naddition, excessive challenges are introduced for implementing a variety \r\nof basic operations with the duty-cycling technique, which could \r\ndeteriorate the performances of a series of important network services, \r\nlike information dissemination, data acquisition, end-to-end packet \r\ndelivery, etc. In this proposal, we aim at studying fundamental \r\nchallenges, and further achieving a sustainable and efficient \r\ncommunication design in duty-cycling sensor networks.\r\n\r\nWe first investigate the problem of controlling node sleep intervals so as \r\nto achieve the min-max energy fairness to maximize the network lifetime. \r\nWe theoretically formulate the Sleep Interval Control (SIC) problem and \r\nfind it a convex optimization problem. By utilizing the convex property, \r\nwe decompose the original problem and propose a distributed algorithm, \r\ncalled GDSIC. In GDSIC, sensor nodes can tune sleep intervals through a \r\nlocal information exchange such that the maximum energy consumption rate \r\nin the network approaches to be minimized. After balancing the \r\nnetwork-wide energy consumption, we further optimize the data collection \r\nservice in duty-cycling networks. We propose a novel approach for the sink \r\nnode to collect the network-wide data. The routing structure of data \r\ncollection is additively updated with the movement of the sink node. With \r\nthis approach, we only perform a local modification to update the routing \r\nstructure while the routing performance is bounded and controlled compared \r\nto the optimal performance. The proposed protocol is easy to implement. \r\nOur analysis shows that the proposed approach is scalable in maintenance \r\noverheads, performs efficiently in the routing performance, and provides \r\ncontinuous data delivery in the network.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Monday, 6 February 2012\r\n\r\nTime:                   4:15pm - 6:15pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3304\r\n                         lifts 17/18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Yunhao Liu (Supervisor)\r\n                         Dr. Ke Yi (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tProf. Lionel Ni\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Sustainable and Efficient Data Transmission in Duty-Cycling Sensor Networks"], "lenArticle": 377},

Historically, the choice\r\nof row-store layout is not merely for technical simplicity, but rather\r\nmotivated by the typical workloads in transactional processing which\r\naccess data on the granularity of entity. However, with the emergence of\r\nbig data comes another kind of queries more analytical in nature, which do\r\nnot care about the details of certain entities, but target at high-level\r\nstatistical information that help with data mining tasks in warehouse\r\nenvironment. Analytical workloads are read-intensive, attribute-focused\r\nand big data-oriented, which contrast sharply with transactional queries.\r\nIn view of these new characteristics, write-optimized row-store layout is\r\nno longer the best choice and redesign of physical layer is needed.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, column-oriented storage structure has gained popularity\r\nin both research and industrial communities. By organizing tabular data\r\ncolumn-by-column in physical layer, column-store outperforms row-stores in\r\nprocessing analytical workloads as it need only access relevant\r\nattributes. Advantages of column-store over row-store include high I/O\r\nefficiency, great chances of compression and high flexibility in adapting\r\nto dynamic workloads. Nevertheless, quite a few challenges exist ranging\r\nfrom tuple reconstruction to compression-based query execution.\r\n\r\nIn this survey, we review major research results towards building a\r\nhigh-performance, analytics-oriented column-store warehouse system. We\r\nstart from the description of the storage layout and execution engine in\r\nC-Store, an open-source column-store system. In the following, we delve\r\ninto several key issues in column-store system such as compression, tuple\r\nreconstruction, materialization strategies. We summarize key challenges\r\nand typical solutions, and describe from a system perspective how they\r\nhelp improve the performance of analytical workloads processing. Also, we\r\nreview major issues of applying column-store techniques in distributed\r\nenvironment such as MapReduce.

A sensor works in cycles, in each of which it stays active for a fixed \r\nduration, and then sleeps until the next cycle. The frequency of such cycles \r\ndetermines the portion of time that a sensor is active, and is the dominant \r\nfactor on its battery life. The majority of existing work assumes globally \r\nsynchronized WSN where all sensors have the same frequency. This leads to waste \r\nof battery power for applications that entail different accuracy of \r\nmeasurements, or environments where sensor readings have large variability.\r\n\r\nTo overcome this problem, we propose LS, a query processing framework for \r\nlocally synchronized WSN. We consider that each sensor ni has a distinct \r\nsampling frequency fi, which is determined by the application or environment \r\nrequirements. The complication of LS is that ni has to wake up with a network \r\nfrequency Fi>=fi, in order to forward messages of other sensors. Our goal is \r\nto minimize the sum of Fi without delaying package transmissions. \r\nSpecifically, given a routing tree, we first present a dynamic programming \r\nalgorithm that computes the optimal network frequency of each sensor; then, we \r\ndevelop a heuristic for finding the best tree topology, if this is not fixed in \r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 29 February 2012\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3401\r\n \t\t\tLifts 17/18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dimitris Papadias (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Algorithms for Local Sensor Synchronization"], "lenArticle": 267},

Such an \r\nexplosive demand on the content delivery over content-oriented networks \r\nhas recently gained much attention with the increasing popularity and the \r\nsuccessful deployment of commercial systems. However, this also poses \r\nsignificant challenges on the existing network infrastructure due to the \r\ntremendous consumption of resources such as storage, link bandwidth and \r\nthe involved network traffic cost. With the large amount of contents \r\navailable in the entire network, how to efficient utilize the network \r\ncapacity is becoming a critical problem in both research and practice.\r\n\r\nThe deployment of cache servers in content-oriented networks can help to \r\nalleviate the resource scarcity. Cached contents are usually located close \r\nto users, which can greatly reduce the traffic on the network backbone \r\nwith the improved performance. Despite a large amount of existing caching \r\nmecha- nisms in the conventional web applications, little has been done in \r\nthe cache design for content-oriented networks, which exhibit unique \r\ntraffic features and user behaviors. Furthermore, there is a great \r\npotential as well as challenge in exploring collaboration among caching \r\nservers given the distributed nature and the autonomous property of cache \r\nservers.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, we have addressed the design and the analysis of \r\ncollaborative caching mechanisms in different scenarios of \r\ncontent-oriented networks.We first discuss caching strategies in \r\nstructured content- oriented networks. Based on the hierarchical topology \r\nderived from a real-world IPTV system, we have proposed an efficient \r\nmechanism to explore the capacity of the existing system infrastructure. \r\nWe then explore collaborative caching mechanisms in peer-to-peer (P2P) \r\napplications, which are considered as typical unstructured \r\ncontent-oriented networks. We specifically focus on eliminating the \r\ninter-domain traffic cost, with respect to dynamic P2P traffic patterns, \r\npeering policies and cache server capacity constraints. We then design \r\nincentive mechanisms for the cache collaboration in wireless multimedia \r\nsystems, in order to promote the potential collaboration among cache \r\nservers of different administrative domains.\r\n\r\nThrough studies in both structured and unstructured content-oriented \r\nnetworks, we can observe that the overall system performance can greatly \r\nbenefit from the proposed collaborative caching mechanisms while the \r\ninvolved traffic cost is also minimized. Caching decisions are made based \r\non specific topological properties, capacity constraints and optimization \r\nobjectives. The analysis on incentive mechanisms further improves the \r\npracticability of proposed mechanisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Monday, 12 March 2012\r\n\r\nTime:                   3:30pm - 4:30pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3405\r\n                         lifts 17/18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Bo Li (Supervisor)\r\n                         Dr. Lin Gu (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tProf. Chin-Tau Lea (ECE)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Collaborative Caching in\u00a0Content-Oriented Networks"], "lenArticle": 446},

Various \r\nsubmatrix models have been proposed to describe different local \r\ncorrelations, among which, the order-preserving submatrix (OPSM) model is \r\nproposed to capture the fact that the entry values of a set of rows follow \r\nthe same trend under a set of columns. In this thesis, we systematically \r\nstudy the problem of mining OPSM patterns to address various real \r\napplication needs.\r\n\r\nIn gene expression analysis, as the OPSM model is regarded to be \r\nrestrictive and not practical when sample contamination inevitably exists, \r\nwe consider two relaxation strategies to relax the strict OPSM model. \r\nThree relaxed OPSM models and the corresponding pattern mining methods \r\nhave been proposed. Experimental studies on real biological data show that \r\nour relaxed OPSM models lead to the discovery of interesting correlations \r\nwith high biological significance. The experiments also justify the \r\nefficiency of our proposed pattern mining methods.\r\n\r\nDue to the prevalence of uncertain data, we define new probabilistic \r\nmatrix representations, and formalize a novel probabilistic OPSM (POPSM) \r\nmodel. We propose an efficient POPSM mining framework called ProbApri. We \r\ndemonstrate the superiority of our approach by two applications of POPSM. \r\nExperiments on biological datasets show that the POPSM model better \r\ncaptures the characteristics of the expression levels of biologically \r\ncorrelated genes. Experiments on a RFID trace dataset demonstrate the \r\neffectiveness of our POPSM model in capturing the common visiting behavior \r\namong users.\r\n\r\nData in applications like recommender systems can also be organized as \r\nmatrices, which however usually have extremely large size and high degree \r\nof sparsity. We propose a sparse OPSM (SOPSM) model for sparse matrices, \r\nand adopt two criteria to control the number and distribution of patterns \r\nmined from large matrices. Accordingly, we formulate a constrained SOPSM \r\nmining problem, and develop an effective approach called Quick Probing \r\n(QP) and its parallelization scheme. Experiments on two datasets from real \r\nrecommender systems show that the QP framework achieves high scalability \r\nand is efficient for handling matrices having millions of rows and \r\ncolumns.

In this proposal, we focus on \r\ntwo problems related to user preferences: understanding user preferences and \r\nutilizing user preferences in finding preferable products.\r\n\r\nIn understanding user preferences, we propose two sub-problems.

With the development of the Internet, ER for hidden Web \r\ndata has become increasingly important in many real-world applications such as \r\nonline search engines, web data integration and so on. Hidden Web data often \r\noriginates from different data sources that usually have different schemas.

Different from the general \r\nscene parsing task, urban scene parsing is a typical representative of the \r\nconstrained scene parsing task, which is an active research area. In this \r\nproposal, we investigate the methods for the urban scene parsing task with \r\nimages and scan data, from small scale to large scale.\r\n\r\nWith both images and scan data, we propose a novel joint image and scan data \r\nscene parsing method which can be applied in large scale urban scenes. The \r\nproposed method can automatically obtain necessary training data from the input \r\ndata, which is usually obtained through manually labeling in previous work. \r\nWith the automatically obtained training data, we use an associative \r\nHierarchical CRF to jointly optimize the segmentation of images and scan point \r\ncloud simultaneously. With only images, we propose a nonparametric scene \r\nparsing method which exploits the partial similarity between images, and a \r\nparametric scene parsing method, the supervised label transfer method. The \r\npartial similarity based nonparametric method involves no training process and \r\nreduces the inference problem in the scene parsing to a matching problem. By \r\ncontrast, the supervised label transfer method transforms the inference problem \r\nin the scene parsing to a supervised matching problem. Last but not least, we \r\npropose an efficient Iterative Passive-Aggressive learning algorithm to learn \r\nthe parameters involved in the random field models to formulate the scene \r\nparsing task, from some given training data. The parameters are iteratively \r\nupdated by solving a structured output optimization problem, sharing similar \r\nupdating form as the projected sub-gradient methods but without using any \r\npredefined step-size.

For\r\nexample, finding the nearest objects around a person requires knowledge\r\nabout the locations of the objects and the location of the person. The\r\nproposed research investigates methods for identifying the location of an\r\nobject within a space. The process is known as localization. The proposed\r\ninvestigates localization methods based on WiFi signal strengths for\r\nindoor environment.\r\n\r\nA major challenge for indoor localization is that GPS (Global Positioning\r\nSystem) is not available indoor. Thus, a sensor infrastructure must be\r\navailable to make indoor localization possible. This proposal focuses on\r\napproaches based on analyzing the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of WiFi\r\nsignals. Specifically, RSS are measured at each location and stored in the\r\nserver. The measurements are called location signature of the space. When\r\na user requests localization service, he/she obtains the RSS signature and\r\ncompares with the location signatures at the server. These approaches have\r\nlow setup cost due to the high availability of WiFi clients on mobile\r\nclients and access points (APs) inside most buildings.\r\n\r\nTraditional localization methods aim to improve localization accuracy.\r\nThat is, the error between the estimated location and the actual location.\r\nHowever, they assume that the location signatures are accurate, but this\r\nis not true because RSS changes due to noise, obstacles and environmental\r\nchanges, causing localization accuracy to deteriorate quickly. Thus, they\r\nrequire regular calibration on the location signatures to maintain\r\nlocalization accuracy.\r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to improve both the accuracy and stability of indoor\r\nlocalization. Instead of using absolute RSSs in comparing the signatures,\r\nwe propose a rule-based approach, which can achieve high localization\r\naccuracy and stability. The main idea is to maintain the relations (i.e.,\r\n\"less than\", \"equal to\", and \"greater than\") of the RSSs of the access\r\npoints received at a location and to set up rules to match the RSS\r\nsignatures based on the relations. Rule-based approach enhances stability\r\nbecause the relation of two RSS signals could remain the same even when\r\ntheir values are changing constantly.\r\n\r\nTo further address the stability problem, we introduce two important\r\nnotions, the stability and sensibility of APs, at a certain location. We\r\nnote that although the RSSs from APs change over time, some APs change\r\nless than others, thus having higher stability, while some APs have\r\nstronger signals than other, thus having higher sensibility. Based on the\r\nstability and sensibility of APs, we introduce a method to estimate the\r\nstability of a rule to measure the trustworthiness of the rule for\r\nlocalization. We present an effective and simple approach to create the\r\nrelations and rules, as well as heuristics to select the rules for use in\r\nlocalization. We develop a suite of rule-based localization methods based\r\non different combinations of the techniques, including pure matching of\r\nlocation signatures, rule-based system with and without AP stability and\r\nrule-based systems with and without rule stability. We implemented the\r\nlocation methods and tested them in the Department's Lab area and the\r\nresults show that rule-based system with or without stability measures\r\nperform much better than pure signature comparison and rule-based system\r\nwith stability consideration perform better that those without stability\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Wednesday, 9 May 2012\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 5510\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Dik-Lun Lee (Supervisor)\r\n                         Dr. Wilfred Ng (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["A Rule-Based Approach to Indoor Localization based on WiFi Signal Strengths"], "lenArticle": 592},

A challenge \r\nbehind the cloud computing is how to store, share and process the users\u2019 data \r\nsecurely and efficiently. Therefore, we need to enhance the file system and \r\nmemory abstractions for the cloud computing paradigm.\r\n\r\nOn the traditional computing architecture, the user have full control over \r\ntheir data on their computer or in their private datacenter. However, when \r\nusers store private data in shared datacenters, they lose control over how the \r\ndata are stored and accessed. Multiple classes of personnel may access the \r\nphysical storage media and potentially read the data. While strong \r\ncryptographic methods can protect user files from unauthorized accesses, they \r\nincur computational overhead, and make it difficult for the infrastructure \r\nprovider to optimize the storage space with effective compression and \r\ndeduplication. To provide strong protection on user data, we design a new file \r\nsystem called BIFS (Bit-Interleaving File System). Focusing on the privacy \r\nprotection of the on-disk state, BIFS re-orders data in user files at the bit \r\nlevel, and stores bit slices at distributed locations in the storage system. \r\nWhile providing strong privacy protection, BIFS still retains part of the \r\nregularity in user data, and thus enables the infrastructure provider to \r\nperform a certain level of space optimization (e.g., compression).\r\n\r\nStoring the users\u2019 data with strong privacy protection is not enough. Sharing \r\nand processing the user\u2019s data efficiently on the cloud infrastructure remains \r\na factor which prevents many users from stepping into the cloud computing era. \r\nMessage passing introduces too much burden to the users for programming. \r\nTraditional Distributed Shard Memory (DSM) design fails in scalability and \r\nefficiency. Focusing on the efficiency and flexibility, while changes the \r\nuser\u2019s programming behavior as less as possible, we combine the advantages of \r\ntransactional memory and distributed shared memory to design a scalable \r\ndistributed transactional memory.\r\n\r\nWe implement BIFS and SDTM to examine their performance characteristics. The \r\ncloud storage service used for our implementation of BIFS is the Amazon Simple \r\nStorage Service (S3). The comparison with several existing network or \r\nInternet-based file systems shows that BIFS provides robust file system \r\nfunctions with satisfactory throughput on S3. The evaluation of SDTM also shows \r\nit is both scalable and efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 16 May 2012\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:30am \u2013 12:30pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Lin Gu (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Constructing enhanced file system and memory abstractions on public cloud"], "lenArticle": 429},

SFS is a statistical \r\nsummary that describes the distribution of minor allele frequency (MAF) at \r\na set of gene sites from a group of individuals.

To keep up with the hardware innovation, \r\nsoftware developers are undertaking a revolution from sequential \r\nprogramming to concurrent programming. This revolution, however, is slow \r\nand challenging due to the exponential complexity in reasoning about \r\nconcurrency. In particular, \"Heisenbugs\" such as data races which are \r\nnon-deterministic pervasively infect concurrent software, making \r\nconcurrent program debugging notoriously difficult.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, we develop efficient and scalable methods in dealing \r\nwith the Heisenbugs along four directions: multiprocessor deterministic \r\nreplay, predictive trace analysis, trace simplification, and data sharing \r\nreduction. We first propose LEAP, a lightweight record and replay system \r\nthat makes Heisenbugs reproducible in general multiprocessor environments. \r\nUnderpinned by a new local-order based replay theorem, LEAP is fast, \r\nportable, and deterministic. As long as a Heisenbug manifests once, LEAP \r\nis able to deterministically reproduce it in every subsequent execution, \r\nand more importantly, with much lower overhead compared to the state of \r\nthe art.\r\n\r\nWe second propose PECAN, a persuasive predictive trace analysis system \r\nthat is able to predict Heisenbugs from normal executions. The salient \r\nfeature of PECAN is that, in addition to predict Heisenbugs, it generates \r\n``bug hatching clips\" that instruct the program to deterministically \r\nexercise the predicted bugs. With PECAN, programmers are provided with the \r\nfull execution history and context information to understand the bug, \r\nwhich dramatically expedites the debugging process. To further address the \r\nschedule space explosion problem in predicting bugs, we propose \r\nTraceFilter, an efficient algorithm that significantly improves the \r\nscalability of general predictive trace analysis by removing the trace \r\nredundancy with respect to the Heisenbugs.\r\n\r\nWe third propose SimTrace, a static trace simplification technique that \r\neffectively reduces the number of thread context switches in the buggy \r\ntrace. A simplified trace with fewer context switches greatly lessens the \r\ndebugging effort by prolonging the sequential reasoning of concurrent \r\nprogram execution and reducing the number of places in the trace where we \r\nneed to look for the cause of the bug. More importantly, through reasoning \r\nabout the computation equivalence of the trace offline, SimTrace \r\ndramatically improves the efficiency of trace simplification. SimTrace \r\nscales well to traces with more than 1M events, making it attractive to \r\npractical use.\r\n\r\nWe fourth propose Privateer, an execution privatization technique that \r\nsoundly privatizes a subset of shared data accesses in a vast category of \r\nconcurrent programs - scheduler-oblivious programs. Underpinned by a \r\nprivatization theorem, Privateer is able to reduce the data sharing in \r\nscheduler-oblivious programs without introducing any additional program \r\nbehavior. Moreover, the non-deterministic thread interleavings on the \r\nprivatized accesses are isolated without adding any synchronization. With \r\nPrivateer, many real world Heisenbugs are fixed and a wide range of \r\nconcurrency problems are alleviated without impairing the execution \r\nparallelism.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Tuesday, 22 May 2012\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 1504\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Charles Zhang (Supervisor)\r\n                         Dr. Lin Gu (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung\r\n \t\t\tDr. Sunghun Kim\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Efficient and Scalable Methods for Concurrent Program Debugging"], "lenArticle": 497},

Transfer \r\nlearning is particularly useful when we only have limited labeled data in a \r\ntarget domain, which requires that we consult one or more auxiliary or source \r\ndomains to gain insight on how to solve the target problem. Thus, the key point \r\nfor successful knowledge transfer is that one or more \u201cright\u201d source data \r\nshould be given by the problem designer at the learning time. However, it is \r\nvery difficult to identify a proper set of source data. An intuitive idea is \r\nwhether we can directly seek the needed source data from the open Web. In this \r\nthesis, we try to study how to extend the existing transfer learning techniques \r\nto cope with the need for transfer learning from the massive and noisy Web \r\ndata. We focus on tackling the following four research issues: (1) Transfer \r\nover information gap; (2) Transfer from heterogeneous data; (3) Transfer with \r\npartially labeled correspondence; (4) Selective transfer from massive and noisy \r\nsources. For each of the above mentioned issues, we first conduct extensive \r\nstudy on the difficulty of the problems, and then propose a series of effective \r\nsolutions accordingly. Moreover, to cope with the need for manipulating the \r\nmassive Web data as the source, we also investigate how to make our transfer \r\nlearning models to be scalable with the assist of distributed computing \r\ntechniques.

These models \r\nhave a tree structure, in which the internal nodes represent latent variables \r\nwhereas the leaf nodes represent manifest variables.  They allow fast inference \r\nand have been used for multidimensional clustering, latent structure discovery, \r\ndensity estimation, and classification.\r\n\r\nThis thesis makes two contributions to the research of latent tree models. The \r\nfirst contribution is an new application of latent tree models in spectral \r\nclustering.  In spectral clustering, one defines a similarity matrix for a \r\ncollection of data points, transforms the matrix to get the so-called Laplacian \r\nmatrix, finds the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix, and obtains a partition \r\nof the data points using the leading eigenvectors.  The last step is sometimes \r\nreferred to as rounding, where one needs to decide how many leading \r\neigenvectors to use, determine the number of clusters, and partition the data \r\npoints.\r\n\r\nWe propose to use latent tree models for rounding.  The method differs from \r\nprevious rounding methods in three ways. First, we relax the assumption that \r\nthe number of clusters equals the number of eigenvectors used. Second, when \r\ndeciding how many leading eigenvectors to use, we not only rely on information \r\ncontained in the leading eigenvectors themselves, but also make use of the \r\nsubsequent eigenvectors.  Third, our method is model-based and solves all the \r\nthree subproblems of rounding using latent tree models.  We evaluate our method \r\non both synthetic and real-world data.  The results show that our method works \r\ncorrectly in the ideal case where between-clusters similarity is 0, and \r\ndegrades gracefully as one moves away from the ideal case.\r\n\r\nThe second contribution is an extension to latent tree models.  While latent \r\ntree models have been shown to be useful in data analysis, they contain only \r\ndiscrete variables and are thus limited to discrete data. One has to resort to \r\ndiscretization if analysis on continuous data is needed.  However, this leads \r\nto loss of information and may make the resulting models harder to interpret.\r\n\r\nWe propose an extended class of models, called pouch latent tree models, that \r\nallow the leaf nodes to represent continuous variables.  This extension allows \r\nthe models to work on continuous data directly.  The models also generalize \r\nGaussian mixture models, which are commonly used for model-based clustering on \r\ncontinuous data. We use pouch latent tree models for facilitating variable \r\nselection in clustering, and demonstrate on some benchmark data that it is more \r\nappropriate to facilitate variable selection than to perform variable selection \r\ntraditionally.  We further demonstrate the usefulness of the models by \r\nperforming multidimensional clustering on some real-world basketball data.  Our \r\nresults exhibit multiple meaningful clusterings and interesting relationships \r\nbetween the clusterings.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Monday, 4 June 2012\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3315\r\n                         lifts 17/18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Nevin Zhang (Supervisor)\r\n                         Prof. James Kwok (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Brian Mak\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Latent Tree Models: An Application and an Extension"], "lenArticle": 494},

In this thesis, we focus on \r\ntwo problems related to user preferences: understanding user preferences \r\nand utilizing user preferences.\r\n\r\nIn understanding user preferences, we propose two sub-problems when we \r\nconsider temporal user preferences. The first sub-problem is called \r\nattribute-based subsequence matching (ASM) : given a query sequence and a \r\nset of sequences, considering the attributes of elements, we want to find \r\nall the sequences which are matched by this query sequence. We propose an \r\nefficient algorithm for problem ASM by applying the Chinese Remainder \r\nTheorem. The second sub-problem is to find all the attribute-based \r\nfrequent subsequences. We adapt an existing efficient algorithm for this \r\nsecond subproblem to show that we can use the algorithm developed for the \r\nfirst sub-problem. Experimental results show that frequent subsequences \r\nreflect user preferences, and our algorithms are scalable in large \r\ndatasets. This work can stimulate a lot of existing data mining problems \r\nwhich are fundamentally based on subsequence matching.\r\n\r\nIn utilizing user preferences, we identify and tackle three sub-problems, \r\nfinding top-k profitable products, finding top-k popular products, and \r\nfinding K-dominating competitive price. The former two sub-problems are \r\nabout designing new products, while the latter one is about pricing new \r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nIn finding top-k profitable products, we consider generalized user \r\npreferences, derived from the skyline concept. We propose a dynamic \r\nprogramming approach which can find the optimal solution when there are \r\ntwo attributes to be considered. We show that this problem is NP-hard when \r\nthere are more than two attributes. Two greedy algorithms are proposed and \r\none of them has theoretical bounds. We also consider this problem on \r\ndynamic datasets and propose update algorithms for different update \r\noperations. We extend this problem by considering another form of customer \r\npreferences, namely tolerant customer preferences in finding top-k popular \r\nproducts. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and propose a \r\n0.63-approximate algorithm for this problem. Extensive experiments show \r\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of our approaches on both synthetic and \r\nreal datasets.\r\n\r\nIn finding K-dominating competitive price in which we consider generalized \r\nuser preferences only, we propose an efficient algorithm. We utilize \r\nspatial properties for pruning to speed up our algorithm.

We first present a practical \r\nalgorithm for surface reconstruction from a point cloud, which runs in O(n \r\nlog n) time, where n is the number of sample points. This is optimal in \r\nthe pointer machine model.  The only existing O(n log n)-time algorithm \r\ndue to Funke and Ramos is far from practical as it involves several \r\nsophisticated data structures, including the well-separated pair \r\ndecomposition, approximate directional nearest neighbor searching, and \r\napproximate range searching. Our algorithm is based on a variant of the \r\nstandard octree, and is much simpler.\r\n\r\nWe investigate the complexity of edge flips in a surface mesh. Given a \r\nsurface mesh whose vertices are dense with respect to the local feature \r\nsize and whose triangles have angles at least a constant, we prove that \r\none can flip edges in linear time such that all triangles have almost \r\nempty diametric balls. As a corollary, a planar triangulation with a \r\nconstant angle lower bound can be converted to the Delaunay triangulation \r\nin linear time. It is known that a general planar triangulation needs \r\n\u03a9(n2) edge flips to become Delaunay.\r\n\r\nUsing the edge flip results, we design an efficient algorithm to update a \r\ndeforming surface mesh, which is specified only by a dense sample of n \r\npoints that move with the surface. Although edge flips alone cannot \r\nimprove the angles in the mesh substantially after they worsen, they can \r\nbe used in conjunction with vertex insertions and deletions to restore the \r\nmesh quality. Under a reasonable motion model, we can enforce bounded \r\naspect ratios and a small approximation error throughout the entire \r\ndeformation.

This modeling of cities reduces \r\nde facto to that of building facades. The accurate extraction and partition of \r\nindividual facades and the semantic analysis of each individual facade are two \r\nmain challenges.\r\n\r\nThe key to solve these problems is using urban features: rectilinearity and \r\nsymmetry. First, a joint 2D-3D methods assuming rectilinear boundary of facade \r\nparses the environment into buildings, the ground, and the sky; for the first \r\ntime, buildings are further partitioned into individual facades using a dynamic \r\nprogramming optimization. The next step detects and segments structural \r\nelements in individual facade by exploiting the information redundancy of \r\nrepetition. We propose a dual image- and transform-space optimization method, \r\ncapable of simultaneously discovering multiple interfering repetitions, and a \r\nper-pixel symmetry segmentation method that can extract repetitive elements \r\nfrom background walls.

Compared with continuous density \r\nhidden Markov model (CDHMM), the dominant acoustic model used in modern \r\nASR systems, DHMM has inherently attractive properties: it uses \r\nnon-parametric state output distributions and takes only O(1) time to get \r\nthe probability value from it; Furthermore, the discrete features used in \r\nDHMM, compared with cepstral coefficients in CDHMM, could be encoded in \r\nfewer bits, lowering the bandwidth requirement in distributed speech \r\nrecognition architecture. Unfortunately, the recognition performance of \r\nconventional DHMMis significantly worse than that of CDHMM due to the \r\nlarge quantization error and the use of multiple independent streams. In \r\nthis proposal, we propose to reduce the quantization error of DHMM by \r\nusing a very large codebook with tens of thousands of codewords (in \r\nconventional DHMM, the number of codewords in a codebook usually ranges \r\nfrom 256 to 1024). An extensive literature review is given in the proposal \r\nto show that very large codebook in DHMMis novel and necessary. The \r\nchallenges to use large codebook are discussed, with a novel framework \r\ncalled subspace high-density discrete HMM (SHDDHMM) to solve the problems. \r\nA large vocabulary continuous speech recognition task is used to evaluate \r\nthe proposed framework, showing the feasibility and benefits of DHMM with \r\nvery large codebook.

{"date": "2012-05-29", "description": "\nPhD Thesis Proposal Defence\r\n\r\n\r\nTitle: \"Algorithms for Container Loading Problems\"\r\n\r\nby\r\n\r\nMr. Wenbin Zhu\r\n\r\n\r\nABSTRACT:\r\n\r\nThe problems examined originate from industrial projects awarded to our \r\nresearch team. In one project, our team was contracted by a buying agent for a \r\nlarge multi-national retailer to investigate better ways to formulate packing \r\nplans for the loading of goods into multiple containers. Typically, the goods \r\ncome in the form of 3D rectangular carton boxes. They are loaded into 3D \r\nrectangular containers of various standard sizes. Each type of container has a \r\ndifferent associated cost of shipping. The task is to select a set of \r\ncontainers that can contain all items while minimizing this shipping cost. \r\nProducts are loaded with faces parallel to the faces of the container, often \r\nknown as orthogonal packing in literature. We call this problem Multiple \r\nContainer Loading Cost Minimization Problem (MCLCMP).\r\n\r\nSince MCLCMP is an extremely hard combinatorial optimization problem, the main \r\nobjective is to develop heuristic algorithms that can find good solutions in \r\nreasonable time. We will present three algorithms in increasing order of \r\nsophistication and effectiveness: the Set Cover based Binary Search (SCBS) \r\nalgorithm, the Prototype Column Generation (PCG) algorithm, and the Goal-driven \r\nPrototype Column Generation (GD-PCG) algorithm.\r\n\r\nAll three algorithms are based on a set cover formulation for MCLCMP. If a set \r\nof boxes can be loaded into a container, we call the set of boxes and the \r\nassociated container a loading pattern. MCLCMP can be naturally formulated as a \r\nset cover (SC) problem, where the set to be covered is the set of all boxes and \r\na loading pattern ``covers'' a subset of boxes. We would like to select loading \r\npatterns (from a set of candidates) to cover all boxes while minimizing the \r\ntotal cost of the associated containers. Our approaches to MCLCMP are \r\nessentially two-level approaches. The burden of finding feasible loading \r\npatterns is left to the algorithms for the Single Container Loading Problem \r\n(SCLP), which is well studied and many algorithm exists in the literature. We \r\nmain mainly focuses on how to efficiently use the SCLP algorithms to produce \r\ncandidate loading patterns and find good solutions to the set cover \r\nformulations.\r\n\r\nIn practice, it is only possible to consider a limited number of loading \r\npatterns since deciding whether a set of boxes can be loaded into a container \r\nis NP-hard. Hence, there is a gap between the optimal solution to the set cover \r\nproblem and the optimal solution to MCLCMP. However, if the set of candidate \r\nloading patterns is sufficiently large and diverse, good solutions can still be \r\nfound. This is the main premise behind our first algorithm.\r\n\r\nOur PCG algorithm combines the strengths of the prototyping concept and the \r\ncolumn generation technique. The prototyping concept is similar to the one used \r\nin product design and software engineering. Although producing high quality \r\nloading patterns is time-consuming (roughly equivalent to solving SCLP), \r\nreasonable guesses for loading patterns can be made quickly. We call such a \r\nguess a prototype, and using prototypes instead of actual loading patterns will \r\nallow us to explore a much larger set of candidates in the set cover problem. \r\nIf the prototypes are close to actual feasible loading patterns (in terms of \r\nthe number of boxes of each type loaded), then there is a high probability that \r\nwe can convert the selected prototypes into actual loading patterns. Since a \r\nlarger set of candidates leads to a better optimal solution for the \r\ncorresponding set cover problem, we are more likely to obtain a better solution \r\nto MCLCMP. Column generation is a standard technique for solving linear \r\nprograms with a huge number of decision variables, where only a small set of \r\ncolumns is initially included and new columns are generated as needed by \r\nsolving a pricing subproblem (in the matrix form of the set cover model, a \r\ncolumn in the coefficient matrix represents a loading pattern). In the case of \r\nMCLCMP, the pricing subproblem is essentially a variant of the single container \r\nloading problem.\r\n\r\nThe GD-PCG algorithm improves on PCG in three respects. Firstly, the PCG \r\nalgorithm carries out the search in two stages and each stage approaches good \r\nsolutions to MCLCMP in its own dimension, whereas GD-PCG searches in both \r\ndimensions at the same time. Secondly, we extend the set cover formulation for \r\nMCLCMP by taking the expected overall volume utilization of the containers in a \r\nsolution into account. Thirdly, once a solution is found, a goal-driven search \r\nis carried out in the solution neighborhood to improve the solution.\r\n\r\nSince MCLCMP can be seen as an extension to the three-dimensional orthogonal \r\nbin packing problem (3D-BPP), we compared our three algorithms with algorithms \r\nspecifically designed for 3D-BPP on standard benchmark. The computational \r\nresults show that our algorithm produces better solutions.  MCLCMP is a new \r\nproblem, no standard benchmark exists. We created a set of 350 instances with \r\nknown optimal solutions based on the characteristics of common products to \r\nevaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms. We also created a set of 190 \r\ninstances based on real order from one of the project for further references.\r\n\r\nComputational experiments on these instances suggest that our PCG algorithm \r\nthat combines the concept of prototyping and column generation is indeed \r\neffective. With the addition of goal-driven feature, GD-PCG is the best among \r\nthe three algorithms. Many real world applications have natural set cover \r\nformulations, where the columns in the constraint matrix of the formulation \r\nhave a natural interpretation. It is also often the case that the pricing \r\nproblems for these applications are NP-hard. Our PCG and GD-PCG approaches to \r\nsolving MCLCMP may therefore be usable in such applications after modification, \r\nor inspire similar approaches within the confines of the problem domain.\r\n\r\nOur approaches to MCLCMP are essentially two-level approaches. Therefore, a \r\nmore effective algorithm for the single container loading problem (SCLP) will \r\nfurther improve the effectiveness. I will investigate SCLP in detail and try to \r\ndevelop new algorithms for SCLP. In addition to directly load products onto the \r\nfloor of a container, it is also common that products are first loaded into \r\npallets and pallets of same base area are then loaded into container.

Driven by the advances in Internet and sensor techniques, the amount of \r\nmultidimensional contents, such as images, trajectories, and video clips, has \r\ngrown to an unprecedented level. Supporting multidimensional objects in large \r\nscale requires significant extensions from traditional databases. One critical \r\nissue is indexing and query processing. In this proposal, we discuss two types \r\nof queries in massive multidimensional datasets: high-dimensional similarity \r\njoin and the most frequent path finding.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of this proposal, we study how to perform parallel \r\nhigh-dimensional joins in the MapReduce paradigm. Specifically, we propose a \r\ncost model to demonstrate that it is important to take both communication and \r\ncomputation costs into accounts as dimensionality and data volume increases. To \r\nthis end, we propose an efficient compression approach which can help \r\nsignificantly reduce both these costs. Moreover, we design two parallel \r\nframeworks which can scale up to massive data sizes and very high \r\ndimensionality. In the second part of this proposal, we address the problem of \r\npath finding by evaluating the desirability of a path from a novel perspective, \r\ni.e., how frequently the path has been taken within the given time constraints. \r\nThis new query not only helps users to learn from the experiences of the past \r\ntravelers, but also takes the variability of road and traffic conditions into \r\naccount. To achieve this goal, we firstly design two indexes for efficient \r\ntrajectory searching and splitting. After that, we develop a \"footmark graph\u201c \r\nconstruction algorithm to calculate the road segment frequencies from raw \r\ntrajectories. Finally, we propose a most \u201dfrequent path finding\u201c algorithm \r\nbased on the \u201dmore frequent\u201c relation in a dynamic programming manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Friday, 15 June 2012\r\n\r\nTime:                   1:30pm - 3:30pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Lionel Ni (Supervisor)\r\n                         Dr. Qiong Luo (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lin Gu\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Two Popular Queries in Massive Multidimensional Datasets"], "lenArticle": 334},

As the size of the data is \r\nontinuously growing, it will outgrow the capabilities of any serial \r\nprocessing techniques and it is therefore necessary to perform the data \r\nanalytics in parallel. We use the Hadoop platform to implement and execute \r\nmost of our data processing lgorithms. However, using Hadoop alone is not \r\nsufficient for spatio-temporal data processing because the underlying \r\nstorage systems do not support efficient spatio-temporal range queries. \r\nExisting spatio-temporal storage systems assume a non-distributed \r\nenvironment handling datasets at the scale of several gigabytes, which \r\nmakes them undesirable for very large spatio-temporal datasets. Therefore, \r\nthere is a notable gap between big data analytics and spatio-temporal data \r\nstorage. It motivates us to build an efficient and scalable storage system \r\nfor big spatio-temporal data analytics.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, we present the design and implementation of CloST, a \r\nscalable big spatio-temporal data storage system to support data analytics \r\nusing Hadoop. The main objective of CloST is to avoid scan the whole \r\ndataset when a spatio-temporal range is given. To this end, we propose a \r\nnovel data model which has special treatments on three core attributes \r\nincluding an object id, a location and a time. Based on this data model, \r\nCloST hierarchically parti- tions data using all core attributes which \r\nenables efficient parallel processing of spatio-temporal range scans. \r\nAccording to the data characteristics, we devise a compact storage \r\nstructure which reduces the storage size by an order of magnitude. In \r\naddition, we proposes scalable bulk loading algorithms capable of \r\nincrementally adding new data into the system.

Such an explosive demand on the \r\ncontent delivery has recently gained much attention with the increasing user \r\npopularity and the successful deployment of commercial systems. However, this \r\nalso poses significant challenges on the existing network infrastructure due to \r\nthe tremendous consumption of resources such as storage, link bandwidth and the \r\ninvolved network traffic cost. With the large amount of contents available in \r\nthe entire network, how to efficient utilize the network capacity is becoming a \r\ncritical problem in both research and practice.\r\n\r\nThe deployment of cache servers in content-oriented networks can help to \r\nalleviate the resource constrains, and also helps to move the content closer to \r\nend users with better user experiences. Cached contents are usually located \r\nclose to users, which can greatly reduce the traffic on the network backbone \r\nwith the improved performance. It also offloads the involved traffic cost by \r\nlimiting the unregulated inter-domain traffic. Despite a large amount of \r\nexisting caching mechanisms for conventional web applications, relatively \r\nlittle has been done in the cache design for content-oriented networks, which \r\nexhibit unique traffic features and user behaviors. Furthermore, there is a \r\ngreat potential as well as challenge in exploring collaboration among cache \r\nservers given their autonomous property and distributed nature.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we address the design and the analysis of collaborative caching \r\nmechanisms in several scenarios within content-oriented networks. We first \r\ndiscuss caching strategies in structured content-oriented networks. Based on \r\nthe hierarchical topology derived from real-world Internet Protocol television \r\n(IPTV) systems, we propose efficient mechanisms to explore the capacity of the \r\nexisting system infrastructure. We then investigate collaborative caching \r\nmechanisms in peer-to-peer (P2P) applications, considered as typical \r\nunstructured content-oriented networks. We specifically focus on eliminating \r\nthe tremendous inter-domain traffic cost, with respect to dynamic P2P traffic \r\npatterns, peering policies and cache server capacity constraints. We then \r\ndesign incentive mechanisms for the cache collaboration in wireless multimedia \r\nnetworks, in order to promote the potential collaboration among selfish cache \r\nservers belonging to different administrative domains.\r\n\r\nThrough studies in both structured and unstructured content-oriented networks, \r\nwe observe that the overall system performance can greatly benefit from the \r\nproposed collaborative caching mechanisms while the involved traffic cost is \r\nalso minimized. Caching decisions are made based on specific topological \r\nproperties, capacity constraints and optimization objectives. The analysis on \r\nincentive mechanisms further improves the practicability of proposed \r\nmechanisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 18 June 2012\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t3:00pm \u2013 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Wenxiong Wang (LIFS)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Bo Li (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tProf. Lin Gu\r\n \t\t\tProf. Chin-Tau Lea (ECE)\r\n                      \tProf. Xiaowen Chu (Comp.

As a result, data center networking has recently \r\nbeen a hot research topic in both academia and industry. A fundamental \r\nchallenge in this area is the design of the data center network that \r\ninterconnects the massive number of servers, and provides an efficient and \r\nrobust platform. In response to this challenge, the research community has \r\nbegun exploring novel interconnection network topologies. One approach is \r\nto use commodity electronic switches or servers to scale out the network, \r\nsuch as Portland, VL2, DCell, BCube, FiConn, etc. The other approach is to \r\nexploit optical devices to build high-capacity switches, such as OSA, \r\nHelios, HyPaC, PETASW, Data Vortex, OSMOSIS, etc. Understandably, this \r\nresearch is still in its infancy. For the first approach, the solutions \r\nproposed so far either scale too slow or suffer from performance \r\nbottlenecks, are server-location dependent, inherit poor availability, can \r\nbe too complex/expensive to be constructed. For the second approach, where \r\nthe entire interconnection network can be regarded as a \u201cgiant\u201d switch, \r\nits performance heavily relies on well-designed packet buffers that \r\nsupport multiple queues, provide large capacity and short response time.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, five algorithms/architectures are presented, addressing on \r\nboth of these issues respectively.

On the other hand, aiming at scalable packet buffers, \r\nwe propose three packet buffer architectures along with their memory \r\nmanagement algorithms based on distributed, parallel and hierarchical \r\nmemory structures respectively.

These methods achieve very fast search speed \r\nby indexing data with binary codes. Although lots of hash functions for various \r\nsimilarity metrics have been proposed, they often generate very long codes due \r\nto their data independence nature. In recent years, machine learning techniques \r\nhave been applied to learn hash functions from data, forming a new research \r\ntopic called hash function learning.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we study two important issues in hash function learning. On one \r\nhand, existing supervised or semi-supervised hash function learning methods, \r\nwhich learn hash functions from labeled data, can be regarded to be passive \r\nbecause they assume that the labeled data are provided in advance. Given that \r\nthe data labeling process can be very costly in practice and the contribution \r\nof labeled data to hash function learning can be quite different, it may be \r\nmore cost effective for the hash function learning methods to select labeled \r\ndata from which to learn. To this end, we propose a novel framework, termed \r\nactive hashing, to actively select the most informative data to label for hash \r\nfunction learning. Under the framework, we develop one simple method which \r\nqueries data labels that the current hash functions are most uncertain about. \r\nExperiments conducted on two real data sets show obvious improvement of our \r\nactive hashing algorithm over previous passive hashing methods. On the other \r\nhand, most existing hash function learning methods only work on unimodal data, \r\nwhich are obviously not the case in many applications, e.g., multimedia \r\nretrieval and cross-lingual document analysis. To apply hash function learning \r\nto multimodal data, we develop three methods under the framework of multimodal \r\nhashing which hashes data points of multiple modalities into one common Hamming \r\nspace. For aligned data, the _rst method is based on spectral analysis of the \r\ncorrelation of the multimodal data. For graph data, the second method falls \r\ninto the category of latent feature models and the hash codes can be obtained \r\nthrough Bayesian inference. For general data, we propose a boosted \r\nco-regularization model which can be efficiently solved by stochastic \r\ngradient-based algorithms. The effectiveness of our models is validated through \r\nextensive comparative study on crossmodal multimedia retrieval.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 9 July 2012\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t3:00pm \u2013 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Man-Yu Wong (MATH)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. James Kwok\r\n \t\t\tProf. Nevin Zhang\r\n \t\t\tProf. Weichuan Yu (ECE)\r\n                         Prof. Irwin King (Comp.

In spectral clustering, one defines a similarity \r\nmatrix for a collection of data points, transforms the matrix to get the \r\nso-called Laplacian matrix, finds the eigenvectors of the Laplacian \r\nmatrix, and obtains a partition of the data points using the leading \r\neigenvectors. The last step is sometimes referred to as rounding, where \r\none needs to decide how many leading eigenvectors to use, to determine the \r\nnumber of clusters, and to partition the data points.\r\n\r\nWe propose to use latent tree models for rounding.  The method differs \r\nfrom previous rounding methods in three ways.  First, we relax the \r\nassumption that the number of clusters equals the number of eigenvectors \r\nused. Second, when deciding how many leading eigenvectors to use, we not \r\nonly rely on information contained in the leading eigenvectors themselves, \r\nbut also make use of the subsequent eigenvectors.  Third, our method is \r\nmodel-based and solves all the three subproblems of rounding using latent \r\ntree models.  We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world \r\ndata.  The results show that our method works correctly in the ideal case \r\nwhere between-clusters similarity is 0, and degrades gracefully as one \r\nmoves away from the ideal case.\r\n\r\nThe second contribution is an extension to latent tree models.  While \r\nlatent tree models have been shown to be useful in data analysis, they \r\ncontain only discrete variables and are thus limited to discrete data. \r\nOne has to resort to discretization if analysis on continuous data is \r\nneeded.  However, this leads to loss of information and may make the \r\nresulting models harder to interpret.\r\n\r\nWe propose an extended class of models, called pouch latent tree models, \r\nthat allow the leaf nodes to represent continuous variables.  This \r\nextension allows the models to work on continuous data directly.  These \r\nmodels also generalize Gaussian mixture models, which are commonly used \r\nfor model-based clustering on continuous data.  We use pouch latent tree \r\nmodels for facilitating variable selection in clustering, and demonstrate \r\non some benchmark data that it is more appropriate to facilitate variable \r\nselection than to perform variable selection traditionally.  We further \r\ndemonstrate the usefulness of the models by performing multidimensional \r\nclustering on some real-world basketball data.  Our results exhibit \r\nmultiple meaningful clusterings and interesting relationships between the \r\nclusterings.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 1 August 2012\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Andrew Poon (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Nevin Zhang (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Brian Mak\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung\r\n \t\t\tProf. Bingyi Jing (MATH)\r\n                       \tProf. Manfred Jaeger (Aalborg Univ.)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Latent Tree Models: An Application and an Extension"], "lenArticle": 519},

As a result, huge amounts of user interaction data are generated \r\nand acting as a valuable source for many web tasks. An important task is to \r\nunderstand user preference of each query-document pair based on their click \r\nbehavior, so as to allow search engines to deliver better search results to \r\neffectively serve their users. In this thesis, we study the problem of modeling \r\nuser click behavior in Web search, which is often formalized as a click model \r\nproblem. Click models can automatically infer user-perceived relevance for each \r\nsearch result. This in turn enforces the search engines to deliver better \r\nsearch results.\r\n\r\nIn the context of a click, there are multiple objects: user, query, session, \r\ntask, search result, page region, etc. Previous models generally treat each \r\nobject in isolation, disregarding their associations by only considering \r\nindividual queries and search results. This may bring an over-simplification to \r\na model but sacrifice valuable associative information. The main contribution \r\nof this thesis is a family of models and algorithms to address these \r\nlimitations via modeling the associations between these objects. The proposed \r\nmodel and algorithm family characterizes the associations from six facets. We \r\nfirst put forward a whole-page model to describe the interplay between organic \r\nsearch and sponsored search. We then propose a session-based model and an \r\nintent-bias model to study multiple queries with their corresponding clicks \r\ncollectively. We then introduce a user-based model to complement query and \r\ndocument with user and characterize this triple relationship. We continue with \r\na novel noise-aware model to capture the noise of a click by leveraging above \r\nobjects as its context. Finally, we provide a new solution to combine multiple \r\nproposed click models together and solve a relevance prediction challenge. \r\nFurthermore, we verify all the proposed models through extensive experiments \r\nusing large-scale data collected from a commercial search engine.

As a representative of the constrained scene parsing task, \r\nit is closely related to many important applications paid great attention \r\nrecently, like 3D city modeling and autonomous vehicles navigation. In \r\nthis thesis, we investigate the methodology for the urban scene parsing \r\ntask with images and scan data, as well as the parameter learning of \r\nrandom field models which are wide used to formulate various scene parsing \r\ntasks.\r\n\r\nWith both images and scan data, we propose a novel joint image and scan \r\ndata scene parsing system which can be applied in large scale urban \r\nscenes. The proposed system can automatically obtain necessary training \r\ndata from the input data, which is usually obtained through manually \r\nlabeling in previous work. Then, an associative Hierarchical CRF trained \r\nwith the automatically obtained training data is adopted to jointly \r\nsegment images and scan point cloud by integrating both 3D geometry \r\ninformation and 2D image appearance information. For the urban image \r\nparsing, we propose a nonparametric scene parsing method which exploits \r\nthe partial similarity between images, and a parametric scene parsing \r\nmethod, the supervised label transfer method. The partial similarity based \r\nnonparametric method involves no training process and reduces the \r\ninference problem in the scene parsing to a matching problem. By contrast, \r\nthe supervised label transfer method transforms the inference problem in \r\nthe scene parsing to a supervised matching problem, inheriting the \r\nadvantages of the nonparametric scene parsing methods. These proposed \r\nmethods are evaluated and compared with some state-of-the-art methods on \r\nseveral public datasets and the real Google Street View data, with \r\nencouraging performance achieved.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, we propose an adaptive discriminative learning \r\nalgorithm to learn the parameters of the random field models which are \r\nwidely used to formulate various scene parsing tasks, from some given \r\ntraining data. The parameters are iteratively updated with an adaptive \r\nupdating step-size by solving a structured prediction problem, sharing \r\nsimilar updating form as the Projected Subgradient method.

Although the \r\nduty-cycling technique turns out to notably increase the lifetime of \r\nsensor nodes, the network lifetime can still be largely limited due to the \r\nunevenly distributed network traffic load in many applications. In \r\naddition, excessive challenges are introduced for implementing a variety \r\nof basic operations with the duty-cycling technique, which could \r\ndeteriorate the performances of a series of important network services, \r\nlike information dissemination, data acquisition, end-to-end packet \r\ndelivery, etc. In this thesis, we aim at studying fundamental challenges, \r\nand further achieving a sustainable and efficient communication design in \r\nduty-cycling sensor networks.\r\n\r\nWe first investigate the problem of controlling node sleep intervals so as \r\nto achieve the min-max energy fairness to maximize the network lifetime. \r\nWe theoretically formulate the Sleep Interval Control (SIC) problem and \r\nfind it a convex optimization problem. By utilizing the convex property, \r\nwe decompose the original problem and propose a distributed algorithm, \r\ncalled GDSIC. In GDSIC, sensor nodes can tune sleep intervals through a \r\nlocal information exchange such that the maximum energy consumption rate \r\nin the network approaches to be minimized. After balancing the \r\nnetwork-wide energy consumption, we further optimize the data collection \r\nservice in duty-cycling networks. We propose a novel approach for \r\ncollecting the network-wide data. The routing structure of data collection \r\nis additively updated with the movement of the user. With this approach, \r\nwe only perform a local modification to update the routing structure while \r\nthe routing performance is bounded and controlled compared to the optimal \r\nperformance. Next, although the routing structure can be efficiently \r\nconstructed, the routing structure formation process itself cannot \r\ncompletely ensure the system QoS in data transmissions. Due to limitations \r\nof the duty-cycling operation and interference, not all data transmissions \r\ntasks can be guaranteed to be scheduled within required delay deadlines. \r\nWe thus investigate the multi-task schedulability problem to determine the \r\nmaximum number of tasks that can be scheduled within their deadlines. We \r\nformulate the multi-task schedulability problem, prove its NP-Hardness, \r\nand propose an approximate algorithm. We further extend the proposed \r\nalgorithm by explicitly altering duty cycles of certain sensor nodes so as \r\nto fully support applications with stringent delay requirements to \r\naccomplish all tasks. Finally, time synchronization is required to support \r\nmany duty-cycling protocols and applications. We propose a novel \r\nsynchronization approach called FLIGHT, which leverages the fact that the \r\nfluorescent light intensity changes with a stable period that equals half \r\nof the alternating current's. By tuning to the light emitted from indoor \r\nfluorescent lamps, FLIGHT can intelligently extract the light period \r\ninformation and achieve network wide time calibration by referring to such \r\na common time reference. FLIGHT can achieve tightly synchronized time with \r\nlow energy consumption. In addition, FLIGHT does not occupy radio for the \r\nsynchronization, which is greatly beneficial for a large number of indoor \r\napplications in duty-cycling sensor networks.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 14 August 2012\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t3:00pm \u2013 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Allen Moy (MATH)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Yunhao Liu (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Cunsheng Ding\r\n \t\t\tProf. Lionel Ni\r\n \t\t\tProf. Yang Xiang (MATH)\r\n                         Prof. Bin Xiao (Computing, PolyU)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Towards Sustainable and Efficient Data Transmission in Duty-Cycling Sensor Networks"], "lenArticle": 583},

In order to extract useful information from MR images, image \r\nregistration and image segmentation are two crucial procedures in practice. On \r\none hand, image registration is necessary in order to compare or combine \r\ninformation obtained from different images. On the other hand, image \r\nsegmentation is commonly used to extract more meaningful representation of an \r\nimage for analysis. More importantly, in medical image analysis, this two \r\nprocesses are not independent but closely related to each other. Due to some \r\nimage artifacts introduced in the imaging stage, automatic segmentation relying \r\non the target image alone is still challenging for brain MR images. Therefore, \r\nregistration-based segmentation is essential and commonly applied for \r\nsimplifying the segmentation task. In this thesis, we make contributions in \r\nboth image registration and registration-based segmentation areas.\r\n\r\nIn the first part, we propose a novel image registration method derived from a \r\nphysics model, i.e., the crystal dislocation model. An analogy is made between \r\nthe registration process and the dislocation system in physics, and thus an \r\nelastic interaction between the reference image and the moving image is derived \r\nto drive the registration process. It is proved that the proposed registration \r\nmethod can not only improve the registration accuracy, but also achieve a high \r\nconvergence rate in the optimization procedure.\r\n\r\nIn the second part, we focus on improving the performance of registration-based \r\nsegmentation. In registration-based segmentation methods, the target image is \r\nsegmented through registering the atlas image to the target image and \r\ntransforming the atlas tissue labels to the target image. An atlas is defined \r\nas the combination of an intensity image and its pre-segmented image. In this \r\nthesis, we first propose a new way for atlas construction, as reliable atlases \r\ncan provide useful prior information for the ensuing segmentation. To construct \r\nthe atlas(es) from a population of subjects, we propose to divide the whole \r\npopulation into several subgroups.

Many community detection algorithms that discover \r\ndisjoint or non-overlapping communities have been proposed. However, the \r\ncommunity structure of many networks consists of overlapping communities, \r\nmaking many community detection methods based on the overly strong assumption \r\nof having non-overlapping communities inadequate for practical use. Along the \r\nrecent research direction of extending community detection methods for \r\noverlapping communities, we propose a probabilistic model which infers the \r\nlatent membership vector for each entity in the network for its robustness \r\nespecially when dealing with sparse networks. Computational advantages come \r\nfrom the use of conjugate priors for the latent variables and parameters in the \r\nmodel. We seek to find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the latent \r\nmembership matrix for simplicity and efficiency. Moreover, compared with a \r\nrelated recent model, the likelihood function in our model is more suitable for \r\nmany network datasets and applications.\r\n\r\nIn addition to detecting overlapping communities in networks with only \r\nnon-negative links, we also consider an extension of our model that takes into \r\naccount the existence of negative links. Networks that contain both positive \r\nand negative links are called signed networks. While positive links may \r\nrepresent the similarity relationship among network entities, negative links \r\ndisplay the dissimilarity relationship. This extension amounts to generalizing \r\nthe expression of the likelihood term to adapt to the problem of overlapping \r\ncommunity detection in signed networks.\r\n\r\nFor experimental validation, we report extensive experiments on small toy \r\ndatasets as well as larger synthetic datasets to compare our model against a \r\nclosely related probabilistic method for overlapping community detection in \r\nunsigned networks. We compared the signed version of our method against a \r\nclosely related baseline proposed by ourselves. Moreover, we also perform \r\nexperiments on a few real-world datasets in the comparative study of \r\noverlapping community detection in unsigned networks.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 21 August 2012\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:00am \u2013 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 5510\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. James Kwok (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Detection of Overlapping Communities in Networks \u2013 A Probabilistic Approach"], "lenArticle": 361},

Understanding the innate relations among \r\ndifferent dimensions and data items is one of the most important tasks for \r\nmultidimensional data analysis. However, relational data patterns such as \r\ncorrelations, co-occurrences, and many semantic relations such as \r\ncausality, topics and clusters are usually difficult for users to detect \r\nas the data are usually heterogeneous in nature, huge in amount, and \r\ncontain various statistical features. Although many fundamental data \r\nanalysis techniques such as clustering and correlation analysis have been \r\nwidely used in various application domains, it is still difficult for \r\nusers to understand, interpret, compare, and evaluate analysis results \r\ngiven the lack of context information. Information visualization can be of \r\ngreat value for multidimensional data analysis as it can represent the \r\ndata in intuitive ways with rich context over multiple dimensions and also \r\nsupport explorative visual analysis that keeps humans in the loop.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we introduce advanced visual analysis techniques for \r\nuncovering relational patterns in complicated multidimensional datasets \r\nincluding the structured multivariate data, unstructured text documents, \r\nand heterogeneous datasets like social media data that contain both \r\nstructured and unstructured information. Multiple visualizations are \r\ndesigned for these three data types to represent relational patterns \r\nwithin the same or across different information facets. First, for \r\nmultivariate data, we introduce DICON which is an icon-based cluster \r\nvisualization that embeds statistical information into a multi-attribute \r\ndisplay to facilitate cluster interpretation, evaluation, and comparison. \r\nThen, for unstructured documents, we design a set of visual analysis \r\nsystems, ContexTour, FacetAtlas, and Solarmap, for topic analysis based on \r\nour proposed multifaceted entity relational data model. These systems \r\nrespectively represent the multifaceted topic patterns among name \r\nentities, the multi-relational patterns within topics inside the same \r\ninformation facet, and the semantic relational patterns within topics \r\nacross different information facets. Finally, for heterogeneous data such \r\nas twitter datasets, we introduce Whisper for visualizing dynamic \r\nrelationships between users in context of the information diffusion \r\nprocesses of a given event.  These relations contain information from \r\nthree key aspects: temporal trend, social-spatial extent, and community \r\nresponse of a topic of interest.\r\n\r\nTo our best knowledge, the above techniques are cutting-edge studies of \r\nvisually analyzing relational patterns in structured, unstructured, and \r\nheterogeneous multidimensional datasets.

For \r\nexample, finding the nearest objects around a person requires knowledge \r\nabout the locations of the objects and the location of the person. The \r\nidentification of the location of an object is known as localization. GPS \r\n(Global Positioning System) is widely used for localizing outdoor objects. \r\nUnfortunately, it does not work indoor because GPS signal cannot penetrate \r\ninto buildings.\r\n\r\nThis thesis investigates localization methods in indoor environment. Since \r\nGPS is not available, a sensor infrastructure must be available to make \r\nindoor localization possible. This thesis focuses on approaches based on \r\nthe Received Signal Strength (RSS) of WiFi signals because WiFi is widely \r\navailable in indoor spaces. The main application scenario of this research \r\nis identify the location of a user inside a building. To achieve this \r\ngoal, RSSs are measured at each location of a space and stored in the \r\nserver. The measurements are called location signatures of the space. When \r\nlocalization is performed, the user obtains the RSS signature at her \r\n(unknown) location, and compares it with the location signatures at the \r\nserver. The location with signature matching the user's signature the best \r\nis returned as the location of the user.\r\n\r\nTraditional localization methods aim to improve localization accuracy, \r\ni.e., the error between the estimated location and the actual location. \r\nHowever, they assume that the location signatures are accurate. \r\nUnfortunately, RSSs are unstable due to noise, obstacles and environmental \r\nchanges, causing localization accuracy to deteriorate quickly. Thus, \r\nregular calibration on the location signatures, which is prohibitively \r\nexpensive, is required to maintain high localization accuracy.\r\n\r\nThis thesis aims to improve both the accuracy and the stability of indoor \r\nlocalization. Instead of using absolute RSSs in comparing the location \r\nsignatures, we propose a rule-based approach to achieve high localization \r\naccuracy and stability. The main idea is to maintain the relations (i.e., \r\n\u201cless than\u201d', \u201cequal to\u201d, and \u201cgreater than\u201d) of the RSSs of the access \r\npoints (APs) received at a location and to set up rules to match the RSS \r\nsignatures based on the relations. The rule-based approach enhances \r\nstability because the relation between two RSS signals could remain stable \r\neven when their values are changing constantly.\r\n\r\nTo further address the stability problem, we introduce two important \r\nnotions, the stability and sensibility of an AP, at a location. Although \r\nthe RSSs from APs change over time, some APs change less than the others, \r\nthus having higher stability, and some APs have stronger signals than the \r\nothers, thus having higher sensibility. We introduce methods to estimate \r\nthe stability and sensibility of APs. We present an effective and simple \r\napproach to create the relations and rules, as well as heuristics to \r\nselect the rules for use in localization. We develop a suite of rule-based \r\nlocalization methods based on different combinations of the techniques, \r\nincluding pure matching of location signatures, rule-based system with and \r\nwithout AP stability, and rule-based systems with and without rule \r\nstability. We implemented the location methods and tested them in the \r\nDepartment's Lab area and the results show that rule-based system with \r\nstability consideration performs better that those without stability \r\nconsideration, which in turn performs better than methods based on pure \r\nsignature comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 27 August 2012\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:00am \u2013 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Wai-Ho Mow (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dik-Lun Lee (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Frederick Lochovsky\r\n \t\t\tProf. Raymond Wong\r\n \t\t\tProf. Albert Wong (ECE)\r\n                         Prof. Hong-Va Leong (Comp., PolyU)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["A RULE-BASED APPROACH TO INDOOR LOCALIZATION BASED ON WIFI SIGNAL STRENGTHS"], "lenArticle": 621},

This modeling of \r\ncities reduces de facto to that of building facades. The accurate \r\nextraction and partition of individual facades from urban scenes and the \r\nsemantic analysis of each individual facade are two main challenges.\r\n\r\nThe key to solve these problems is using special features existing in \r\nurban environment: rectilinearity and symmetry. First, a joint 2D-3D \r\nsegmentation methods assuming rectilinear boundary of facade parses the \r\nenvironment into buildings, the ground, and the sky; for the first time, \r\nbuildings are further partitioned into individual facades using the \r\nproposed dynamic programming optimization. The next step detects and \r\nsegments structural elements within individual facade by exploiting the \r\ninformation redundancy of repetition. We propose a dual image- and \r\ntransform-space optimization method based on the formulation of Markov \r\nrandom field (MRF), capable of simultaneously discovering multiple \r\ninterfering repetitions. After that, we extend the MRF formulation to the \r\ndetection of per-pixel symmetry, and then develop a learning-based \r\nsegmentation method that can extract symmetry objects, which are \r\nrecognized as architecture elements, from background walls. Extensive \r\nevaluation on large-scale data sets of cities demonstrates both \r\nquantitative and qualitative improvements of our detection and \r\nsegmentation methods over the state-of-the-art, especially dealing with \r\nmultiple interfering symmetries, low-count symmetries, and architecture \r\nelement extraction, etc.\r\n\r\nThe extracted architecture elements are re-assembled into a set of newly \r\ninvented computer-generated architecture (CGA) grammar rules with contain \r\nrules.

We can find many novel applications of machine \r\nlearning and data mining where transfer learning is helpful, especially \r\nwhen we have limited labeled data in our domain of interest. In this \r\nthesis, we first survey different settings and approaches of transfer \r\nlearning and give a big picture of the field. We focus on latent space \r\nlearning for transfer learning, which aims at discovering a \u201cgood\u201d common \r\nfeature space across domain, such that knowledge transfer become possible. \r\nIn our study, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction framework for \r\ntransfer learning, which tries to reduce the distance between different \r\ndomains while preserve data properties as much as possible. This framework \r\nis general for many transfer learning problems when domain knowledge is \r\nunavailable. Based on this framework, we propose three effective solutions \r\nto learn the latent space for transfer learning. We apply these methods to \r\ntwo diverse applications: cross-domain WiFi localization and cross-domain \r\ntext classification, and achieve promising results. Furthermore, for a \r\nspecific application area, such as sentiment classification, where domain \r\nknowledge is available for encoding to transfer learning methods, we \r\npropose a spectral feature alignment algorithm for cross-domain learning. \r\nIn this algorithm, we try to align domain-specific features from different \r\ndomains by using some domain independent features as a bridge. \r\nExperimental results show that this method outperforms a state-of-the-art \r\nalgorithm in two real-world datasets on cross-domain sentiment \r\nclassification.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 17 September 2010\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3301A\r\n \t\t\tLifts 17/18\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Chak-Keung Chan (CBME)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Qiang Yang (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. James Kwok\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung\r\n                      \tProf. Fugee Tsung (IELM)\r\n                         Prof. Jieping Ye (Comp.

In such applications, the WSN often plays a role of\r\ntransmitter to transfer data readings from the sensory area so that the\r\nnetwork manager or professional user can deduce physical knowledge from\r\nthese readings.

Numerous APs working in close proximity\r\ncontend channel bandwidth through limited number of orthogonal channels,\r\nmaking the hidden terminal problem inevitable, causing severe throughput\r\ndegradation. Mitigating this problem becomes an important step to improve\r\nthe network performance. In this proposal, motivated by real world\r\nexperiments and simulation results, we study how hidden terminals\r\nimpacting the network throughput, and propose solutions to alleviate it.\r\n\r\nTo start with, we model the MAC layer activities of a single cell WLAN\r\nunder the influence of hidden terminals, and identify the causes of unfair\r\nbandwidth allocation.  Unlike existing models, our model can accommodate\r\ndifferent numbers of hidden nodes without increasing the model complexity.\r\nGiven any number of hidden nodes, only four constraints are needed to\r\ndescribe the interaction between stations and the AP with the\r\nconsideration of both uplink and downlink traffic.  Based on our model, we\r\nformulate a bandwidth allocation problem to optimize the network\r\nthroughput and fairness under some predefined requirements by\r\nsystematically tuning AP's and stations' contention window.\r\n\r\nThen, we extend our study to multi-cell WLANs, demonstrating that a severe\r\nthroughput imbalance occurs between downlink TCP flows even in the\r\nsimplest of multi-cell WLANs which contains only two mutual hidden APs via\r\nsimulation and real world test-bed experiments. To solve this unfairness\r\nproblem, we derive an analytical model that describes the interaction\r\nbetween TCP flows at the MAC layer, and formulate the throughput\r\nallocation problem as a nonlinear optimization problem subject to certain\r\nfairness requirements. Our formulation considers real world complexity\r\nsuch as hidden terminals, packet transmission retry limit,and the unique\r\ncharacteristics of TCP traffic. Solving our optimization problem yields\r\nthe optimal MAC layer contention window settings that can lead each TCP\r\nflow to its target end-to-end throughput without any per-flow queuing or\r\nmodification on the TCP sender.\r\n\r\nFinally, we generalize our study to multi-cell WLANs of arbitrary\r\ntopologies in presence with hidden terminals. Combining the rate control\r\nand contention resolution, we formulate a non-convex optimization on top\r\nof the CSMA/CA protocol. Unlike previous approaches that require maximal\r\nweight scheduling or ignore the hidden terminal problem, our formulation\r\nconsiders a realistic IEEE 802.11-based MAC layer model including the\r\nrandom backoff, carrier sensing, frame retransmission and contention\r\nwindow (CW) setting. We propose a simple scheme to transform this\r\nnon-convex problem into a convex one, and derived a distributed algorithm\r\nto obtain the maximum transmission rate and the optimal contention window\r\nsetting.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:  \t\t\tFriday, 8 October 2010\r\n\r\nTime:           \t11:00am - 1:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:          \tRoom 4483\r\n \t\t\tlifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Brahim Bensaou (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lin Gu\r\n \t\t\tProf. Danny Tsang (ECE)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Performance Optimization in IEEE 802.11 WLANs with Hidden Terminals"], "lenArticle": 477},

In some applications, certain desirable properties of \r\nsequences are singled out to refer to randomness. On two important \r\nmeasures about randomness of sequences are concentrated: one is \r\ncorrelation, and the other is linear complexity. In practice,\u00a0binary \r\nsequences are required to have the impulse-like autocorrelation function. \r\nBesides, in frequency hopping (FH) CDMA systems, the maximum Hamming \r\ncorrelation among FH sequences in FH sequence set should meet some \r\ntheoretical bounds. For all these sequences, large linear complexity is \r\ndesirable for cryptographic and anti-jamming purposes.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis proposal, the linear complexity of series of sequences with \r\ndesirable correlation is investigated. The proposal is composed of three \r\nmain parts. In the first part (Chapter 3), the first and only construction \r\nof binary sequences with the three-level autocorrelation values {-1, 3, \r\nN} is studied. Both the linear complexities and the minimal polynomials \r\nof binary sequences obtained from two classes of difference sets with \r\nSinger parameters are explicitly\u00a0determined. In the second part (Chapter \r\n4), two interleaving constructions of binary sequences with optimal \r\nautocorrelation of period N = 0 (mod 4) are investigated. General \r\nresults on the minimal polynomials of binary sequences generated by these \r\ntwo constructions are given. The linear complexities of all the classes of \r\ngenerated sequences are established depending on those of binary sequences \r\nwith ideal autocorrelation. A close relation between the two constructions \r\nis also\u00a0revealed. In the last part (Chapter 5), the linear complexities of \r\nthe FH sequences in optimal sets are derived. Furthermore, the linear \r\ncomplexities of the transformed FH sequences by applying a power \r\npermutation are determined. In order to construct optimal FH sequences \r\nwith large linear complexity, results on how to choose a proper power are \r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:  \t\t\tMonday, 1 November 2010\r\n\r\nTime:           \t2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:          \tRoom 3304\r\n \t\t\tlifts 17/18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Cunsheng Ding (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tDr. Wai-Ho Mow (ECE)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["The Linear Complexity of Sequences with Desirable Correlation"], "lenArticle": 365},

How to e \r\nciently solve convex optimization problem with these datasets is an \r\nimportant topic, which attracts many researchers' interest. Traditional \r\nGradient methods, though highly scalable and easy to implement, are known \r\nto converge slowly. Some more sophisticated algorithms, like Newton \r\nmethod, can converges fast w.r.t number of iteration. How- ever, it is \r\nimpractical to compute or save Hessian matrix even for one iteration when \r\nthe data is of millions dimensions. To overcome these obstacles, several \r\nfast convex optimization methods have been pro- posed recently. This paper \r\ngives an a general introduction to these algorithms and a review of the \r\nliterature. Specially, both deterministic and stochastic, normal and \r\naccelerated gradient decent methods are presented. Another fast \r\noptimization style, called coordinate decent, is also included.

So in many \r\napplications the labeled data is limited, which is called \u2018label data \r\ndeficiency problem'. In machine learning area, many efforts are devoted to \r\nalleviate this problem by requiring the number of labeled data as small as \r\npossible. For example, even though labeled data is limited, abundant \r\nsupply of unlabeled data is available at very low cost. Two learning \r\nframeworks, active learning and semi-supervised learning, are developed to \r\nutilize the information in the unlabeled data to reduce the dependency on \r\nlabeled data. Moreover, besides utilizing unlabeled data, another learning \r\nframework, multi-task learning, can also improve the performance in this \r\nsituation by utilizing the label information in other related tasks.\r\n\r\nMulti-task learning is a learning paradigm to improve the generalization \r\nperformance of a learning task with the help of some other related tasks. \r\nThis learning paradigm has been inspired by human learning activities in \r\nthat people often apply the knowledge gained from previous learning tasks \r\nto help learn a new task. Many methods have been proposed for multi-task \r\nlearning and we classify most existing methods into five categories: \r\ncommon representation approach, task regularization approach, hierarchical \r\nBayesian approach, task clustering approach, and task relationship \r\nlearning approach. Common representation approach is to find common data \r\nrepresentation for multiple tasks. Task regularization approach extends \r\nthe regularized method in single-task learning to multi-task learning by \r\nencoding the task relationship as a regularization term. Hierarchical \r\nBayesian approach utilizes Bayesian hierarchical model for multi-task \r\nlearning. Task clustering approach divides different tasks into several \r\ntask clusters and learns similar (or identical) model or data \r\nrepresentation for the tasks in the same cluster. Task relationship \r\nlearning approach is to learn the task relationship from data \r\nautomatically which seems as a powerful and adaptive approach over the \r\nmethods belonging to other categories.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, we propose a simple but powerful probabilistic framework \r\nto learn task relationship in multi-task learning where the novelty lies \r\nin the matrix variate prior used in our framework and then task \r\nrelationship is very natural to be modeled as a parameter in the matrix \r\nvariate prior. Based on this framework, we develop two concrete methods \r\nfor multi-task learning: Multi-task relationship learning (MTRL) and \r\nMulti-task generalized t process (MTGTP). By utilizing a matrix-variate \r\nnormal distribution as a prior on the model parameters of all tasks, the \r\nobjective function of MTRL can be formulated as a convex problem which has \r\na global optimal solution. MTGTP is a Bayesian method by modeling the task \r\ncovariance matrix as a random matrix with an inverse-Wishart prior and \r\nintegrating it out to achieve Bayesian model averaging to improve the \r\nperformance. Experimental results show that our models can achieve \r\nstate-of-theart performance in many real-world applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:  \t\t\tFriday, 7 January 2011\r\n\r\nTime:           \t3:00pm - 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:          \tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tlifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Nevin Zhang (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. James Kwok\r\n \t\t\tProf. Qiang Yang\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["A Probabilistic Framework for Learning Task Relationships in Multi-Task Learning"], "lenArticle": 520},

These nodes are autonomous devices\r\nwith integrated sensing, processing and communication capabilities. In\r\ngeneral, wireless sensor networks are used to fetch information on\r\nspatio-temporal characteristics of the observed physical world,\r\nspawning numerous unforeseen applications. Due to the special nature\r\nof the deployment environment and sensor node\u2019s intrinsic instability,\r\nnetwork failure happens unpredictably. Besides, A number of\r\napplications, such as ecological habitat monitoring and accident\r\ndetection, inherently rely on persistent and instantaneous sensing\r\ndata. Hence, it proves necessary to associate sensing work and network\r\nmanagement, making the network system more reliable and sustainable.\r\nTherefore, Network diagnosis, a process of deducing the exact root\r\ncause of a failure from a set of observed failure indications, becomes\r\nof great importance in the development of wireless sensor networks.\r\n\r\nThis survey reviews diverse diagnosis approaches for sensor nodes,\r\ndiscusses issues about network diagnosis and management, presents the\r\nstate-of-the-art diagnosis techniques, and finally suggests future\r\ndirections in diagnosis studies. In general, two types of faults would\r\nlead to performance degradation in wireless sensor network.

The other type is data fault, in which a node behaves\r\nnormally in network functions, but fails to fetch or process its\r\nsensing data, thus makes either critical biased or just random errors.\r\nThe design tradeoffs of diagnosis approaches, as well as their\r\noverhead, coupling degree with network, pros and cons, are emphasized\r\nfor comparison. Actually, among these diagnosis techniques, no\r\nspecific design seems the clear favorite across the spectrum.

This so-called co-channel interference, nowadays \r\ninevitable in WLANs, causes severe throughput degradation, and mitigating \r\nthis problem has become an important step towards improving the network \r\nperformance. In this thesis, motivated by real world experiments and \r\nsimulation results, we study how co-channel interference impacts the \r\nnetwork throughput, and propose solutions to alleviate it.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, we model the MAC layer activities of a single-cell WLAN \r\nunder the influence of hidden terminals, and identify the causes of unfair \r\nbandwidth allocation.  Unlike existing models, our model can accommodate \r\ndifferent numbers of hidden nodes without increasing the model complexity. \r\nGiven any number of hidden nodes, only four constraints are needed to \r\ndescribe the interaction between stations and the AP with the \r\nconsideration of both uplink and downlink traffic.  Based on our model, we \r\nformulate a bandwidth allocation problem to optimize the network \r\nthroughput and fairness under some predefined requirements by \r\nsystematically tuning the AP's and stations' contention windows.\r\n\r\nThen, we extend this study to multi-cell WLANs, demonstrating via \r\nsimulation and real world test-bed experiments, that a severe throughput \r\nimbalance occurs between downlink TCP flows even in the simplest of \r\nmulti-cell WLANs where only two mutually hidden APs compete for channel \r\naccess. To solve this unfairness problem, we derive an analytical model \r\nthat describes the interaction between TCP flows at the MAC layer, and \r\nformulate the throughput allocation problem as a nonlinear optimization \r\nproblem subject to certain fairness requirements. Our formulation \r\nconsiders real world complexity such as hidden terminals, packet \r\ntransmission retry limit, and the unique characteristics of TCP traffic. \r\nSolving our optimization problem yields the optimal MAC layer contention \r\nwindow settings that can lead each TCP flow to its target end-to-end \r\nthroughput without any per-flow queuing or modification of the TCP sender.\r\n\r\nFinally, we generalize our study to multi-cell WLANs with arbitrary \r\ntopologies in the presence of the hidden terminals and spatial unfairness. \r\nCombining the rate control and contention resolution, we formulate the \r\noptimal rate allocation problem on top of the CSMA/CA protocol as a \r\nnon-convex optimization problem. Unlike previous approaches that require \r\nmaximal weight scheduling or ignore the hidden terminal problem, our \r\nformulation considers a realistic IEEE 802.11-based MAC layer model \r\nincluding random backoff, carrier sensing, frame retransmission and \r\ncontention window (CW) setting. We propose a simple scheme to transform \r\nthis non-convex problem into a convex one, and derive a distributed \r\nalgorithm to obtain the maximum transmission rate and the optimal \r\ncontention window setting. To further improve the network performance, we \r\nincorporate association control into the cross-layer optimization problem, \r\nreducing the number of hidden terminals by discarding problematic \r\nassociations and optimally re-associating APs and clients. We formulate \r\nsuch a problem as a non-convex mixed integer programming problem, which is \r\nknown to be NP-hard and propose a distributed algorithm to approximate the \r\noptimal solution of this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 19 January 2011\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t11:00am \u2013 1:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Richard So (IELM)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Brahim Bensaou (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Lin Gu\r\n \t\t\tProf. Jogesh Muppala\r\n                      \tProf. Danny Tsang (ECE)\r\n                         Prof. Chun Tung Chou (Comp.

With different sensing components and \r\nlimited computational capability from onboard microprocessors, sensor nodes are \r\nable to gather different local sensing information and process them. Unlike \r\nWSNs which are composed of stationary sensors, mobile sensor networks (MSNs) \r\nhave a new feature of sensor mobility, and are expected to be applied in a \r\nvariety of applications such as battlefield surveillance, hostile environment \r\nmonitoring, and wild animal tracking. This dissertation mainly focuses on the \r\nchallenges and research works of information collection, intrusion detection \r\nand tracking in MSNs. It shows that sensor mobility brings a lot of challenges \r\nin MSNs, but at the same time, it also provides opportunities that can be \r\nexplored for performance enhancement. In practice, sensor network systems are \r\nhighly application driven and their applicability are closely related to \r\ndifferent application environments.\r\n\r\nWe first formulate and study the delay-constrained information coverage problem \r\nin both single hop case and relay assisted case. In single hop case, our \r\nformulation takes advantage of the sensor mobility for sensing information \r\ncollection, which takes place when a sensor moves into the proximity of \r\nstationary sink nodes. While in relay assisted case, by taking full advantage \r\nof sensor mobility and rendezvous during senor node encounter, messages can be \r\ndelivered to a sink node either directly or through relays by other sensor \r\nnodes. Motivated by real application needs, we propose an optimal placement of \r\nsink nodes, and a practical message relay and replacement algorithm for \r\nmaximizing the sensing information collection.\r\n\r\nPrior works in static sensor environments show that constructing sensor \r\nbarriers with random sensor deployment can be effective for intrusion \r\ndetection. In our second application, we study the intrusion detection problem \r\nin MSNs, where it is believed that mobile sensors can improve the barrier \r\ncoverage. Specifically, we focus on providing the k-barrier coverage against \r\nmoving intruders. The inherent relationship between the barrier coverage \r\nperformance and a set of crucial system parameters including sensor density, \r\nsensing range, sensor and intruder mobility is derived.

Great attention from both academia and industry has \r\nbeen devoted into this area. With users not only downloading data but also \r\nuploading data to one another, such peer-assisted systems are easy to \r\ndeploy and have good scalability. However, due to the highly dynamic \r\nnature of distributed peers with heterogeneous capacities and diverse \r\nbehaviors, there still remain several fundamental challenges in \r\nlarge-scale peer-assisted content distribution and video streaming \r\nsystems, with respect to the cost-performance trade-off in peer-assisted \r\nonline hosting and distribution, and the flash crowd problem in P2P live \r\nstreaming, as well as the service qualities of peer-assisted VoD. This \r\nthesis seeks to address these challenges through not only mathematical \r\nmodeling and analysis, but also practical system design and measurement, \r\nin order to bridge theory and practice.\r\n\r\nFirst, to guarantee adequate levels of service quality while conserving \r\nprohibitive server costs, we seek to explore the design space of online \r\nhosting and distribution systems that integrate peer bandwidth \r\ncontributions with strategic server resource provisioning in a \r\ncomplementary and transparent manner. Specifically, we first model and \r\nanalyze new strategies to allocate scarce server resources --- including \r\nboth storage space and bandwidth --- in peer-assisted online hosting \r\nsystems. The objective is to maximize the use of limited server storage \r\nand bandwidth resources to guarantee adequate levels of file availability \r\nand downloading performance, while taking full advantage of peer \r\nassistance. We identify a number of unique challenges involved in such \r\nsystems, and propose our design of resource allocation protocols to \r\naddress these challenges. Based on the guidelines derived from our \r\nanalysis, we design and measure FS2You, a large-scale and real-world \r\nonline hosting system with peer bandwidth assistance and semi-persistent \r\nfile availability. FS2You is designed to dramatically mitigate server \r\nbandwidth costs. We present our architectural and protocol design, as well \r\nas an extensive measurement study at a large scale to demonstrate the \r\neffectiveness of our design, using real-world traces that we have \r\ncollected. To our knowledge, our work represents the first attempt to \r\ndesign, implement, and evaluate a new peer-assisted semi-persistent online \r\nhosting system at a realistic scale. Since the launch of FS2You, it has \r\nquickly become one of the most popular online hosting systems in mainland \r\nChina, and a favorite in many online forums across the country.\r\n\r\nSecond, it is evident from our experiences with real-world P2P live \r\nstreaming systems that, it is not uncommon to have hundreds of thousands \r\nof users trying to join a program in the first few minutes of a live \r\nbroadcast. This phenomenon, unique in live streaming systems, referred to \r\nas the flash crowd, poses significant challenges in the system scalability \r\nand user experience. We develop a mathematical model to capture and \r\nunderstand the inherent relationship between time and scale in P2P \r\nstreaming systems under the flash crowd. Specifically, we show that there \r\nis a fundamental upper bound on the system scale with respect to a time \r\nconstraint. In addition, our analysis has brought forth an in-depth \r\nunderstanding on the effects of the gossip protocol and peer churn. To our \r\nknowledge, our work represents the first attempt to provide an analytical \r\ncharacterization and understanding of the inherent scale-time relationship \r\nin P2P streaming systems, with a particular focus on the flash crowd and \r\nvarious critical factors.\r\n\r\nThird, due to the lack of theoretical foundation and new storage and \r\ntransmission mechanisms, the service qualities --- including the video \r\nstreaming bit rates and the startup and seek latencies --- provided by \r\ncurrent peer-assisted VoD systems are still far from optimum. In practice, \r\nwe design, implement, fine-tune and measure Novasky, a real-world VoD \r\nsystem capable of delivering cinematic-quality video streams to end users. \r\nThe foundation of the Novasky design is a P2P storage cloud, storing and \r\nrefreshing media streams in a decentralized fashion using local storage \r\nspaces of end users. Different from existing peer-assisted VoD systems, it \r\nfeatures a new peer storage and replacement algorithm using Reed-Solomon \r\ncodes and an adaptive server push-to-peer strategy. Novasky has been \r\ndeployed in the Tsinghua University campus network, operational since \r\nSeptember 2009, attracting 10,000 users to date, and providing over 1,000 \r\nDVD or 720p video streams with bit rates of 1 - 2 Mbps. Based on \r\nreal-world traces collected over 6 months, we show that Novasky can \r\nachieve rapid startups within 4 - 9 seconds, and extremely short seek \r\nlatencies within 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we develop a theoretical framework based on queueing models, \r\nin order to (1) justify the superiority of service prioritization based on \r\na taxonomy of requests, and (2) understand the fundamental principles \r\nbehind optimal caching and prefetching designs in peer-assisted VoD \r\nsystems. The focus is to instruct how limited uploading bandwidth \r\nresources and peer caching capacities can be utilized most efficiently to \r\nachieve better system performance. Specifically, we first use priority \r\nqueueing analysis to prove how service quality and user experience can be \r\nstatistically guaranteed, by prioritizing requests in the order of \r\nsignificance, including urgent playback (e.g., random seeks or initial \r\nstartup), normal playback, and prefetching. We then proceed to construct a \r\nfine-grained stochastic supply-demand model to investigate peer caching \r\nand prefetching as a global optimization problem. This can not only \r\nprovide insights in understanding the fundamental characterization of \r\ndemand, but also offer guidelines towards optimal caching and prefetching \r\nstrategies in peer-assisted VoD systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 25 January 2011\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Jingshen Wu (MECH)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Bo Li (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Lin Gu\r\n \t\t\tProf. Qian Zhang\r\n                         Prof. Danny Tsang (ECE)\r\n                         Prof. Jiannong Cao (Computing, PolyU.)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Large-Scale Peer-Assisted Online Hosting, Distribution and Video Streaming Systems: Design, Modeling and Practice"], "lenArticle": 982},

In the first part of the proposal, we show that if the vertices \r\nare dense with respect to the local feature size and the triangles have angles \r\nat least a constant, we can flip edges in linear time such that all triangles \r\nhave almost empty diametric balls.  For a planar triangulation with a constant \r\nangle lower bound, we can flip it to the Delaunay triangulation in linear time. \r\nIt is known that a general planar triangulation needs Omega(n2) edge flips to \r\nbecome Delaunay.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of the proposal, we design an efficient algorithm using the \r\nedge flip results to update a deforming surface mesh, which is specified only \r\nby a dense sample of n points that move with the surface. Although edge flips \r\nalone cannot improve the angles in the mesh substantially after they worsen, \r\nthey can be used in conjunction with vertex insertions and deletions to restore \r\nthe mesh quality.

The \nexponential growth of geometric data on the internet has shifted \nresearchers' focus from computing local, low-level geometry features such \nas curvatures and textures to high-level semantic information such as \nshape parts information and shape structural characteristics (symmetry, \nparallelism, etc.). However, automatically computing these semantic \ninformation is difficult. It is an ill-posed problem since shape semantics \nis based on human perception, which may be subjective even towards the \nsame object.\n\nThis thesis focuses on developing interactive approaches that exploit \nshape semantic information, and respect and preserve them during \nmanipulation and editing. We leverage the user assistance to fully reveal \nand respect semantic information during geometric modeling processes. In \nparticular, this thesis aims at advancing the state-of-the-art techniques \nby incorporating the user intent in two specific geometric applications: \nshape segmentation and shape manipulation.\n\nFirst, we introduce two interactive tools for shape segmentation, which we \ncall cross-boundary brushes and dot scissor. Both tools offer very simple \nand easy-to-use user interfaces that operate at interactive rates. In \ncontrast to the state-of-the-art interactive segmentation tools, our tools \nallow the user to cut out meaningful and functional components using only \na single mouse stroke or click near boundary regions in most cases, making \nthem very convenient to use.

As the spectrum demand for unlicensed band is \r\nincreasing in recent years, Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) in Cognitive \r\nRadio (CR) networks has been proposed to address the spectrum \r\nunder-utilization problem.

The existence of coherence, i.e. local \r\ndata similarity, usually leads to redundancy of data and computations in \r\nvirtually every stage of the pipeline. By exploiting such coherence, we \r\ncan potentially reduce a large amount of unnecessary computations. This \r\nnot only has the benefit of accelerating the process, but also provides \r\nopportunities to improve the result quality with the additional data that \r\nare not available otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we introduce techniques for spatial and temporal data \r\nreuse that benefit a number of real-time rendering and image-processing \r\napplications. For simplicity and efficiency, we explore methods that \r\noperate in image space. Moreover, for all the applications, we seek to \r\ndesign parallel real-time algorithms that executes on the GPU or \r\nmulti-core CPU. This may limit the class of techniques that we can use, \r\nbut the high efficiency can benefit a much wider range of high-performance \r\ngraphics applications.\r\n\r\nFor spatial data reuse, we first show how the results of interpolating \r\nsparse shading data on an image can be improved with an edge-preserving \r\nfilter. We then introduce a sampling scheme that accelerates the costly \r\ncomputation of diffuse indirect illumination by allowing spatial data \r\nshare. Moreover, in the field of image processing, we demonstrate how data \r\nin coherent regions can be reused to fix antialiased edges that are \r\ndamaged by non-linear filters. For temporal data reuse, we introduce a few \r\ntechniques and tools for improving the performance of data reprojection -- \r\na fundamental operation for temporal data reuse. We then propose a \r\ntechnique for effectively amortizing the computation of supersampling over \r\ntime. This comes with a principled analysis of the quality associated with \r\nrepeated reprojection. Finally, we show an efficient frame-interpolation \r\ntechnique that significantly improves framerate for general real-time \r\nrendering applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Monday, 18 April 2011\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3408\r\n                         lifts 17/18\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Pedro Sander (Supervisor)\r\n                         Prof. Long Quan (Chairperson)\r\n                         Dr. Huamin Qu\r\n                         Dr. Chiew-Lan Tai\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Efficient Image-Space Data Reuse in Computer Graphics"], "lenArticle": 351},

In this scenario, there is a central sever as sink. All \r\nother sensor nodes transmit their data packets to sink by multi-hop \r\nforwarding. The reliable and efficient delivery is subject to several \r\nfactors. For example, link dynamics might cause packet loss or loop. The \r\nenergy cost and transmission delay of one-hop forwarding are different in \r\ndiverse media access mechanisms. Data forwarding is thus a critical and \r\nchallenge issue for data collection in wireless sensor networks.\r\n\r\nIn this survey, we discuss the existing data forwarding techniques for \r\ndata collection and present a new taxonomy of them. Based on different QoS \r\nmetrics concerned, routing protocols are classified into five categories: \r\nfairness, reliability, throughput, transmission delay, and energy \r\nconsumption. We also discuss the potential design space of data \r\nforwarding, particularly on the direction of QoS metric optimization under \r\nunsynchronized low duty cycle media access model. In this model, nodes in \r\na local area will not access media simultaneously. Without sleep schedule \r\nof neighbors, the long waiting time could degrade the energy and delay \r\nefficiency. On the other hand, the unsynchronized media access model could \r\nprovide extremely low duty cycle and it does not need the overhead of \r\nsynchronization.

How to reconstruct 3D models for buildings and trees is an important \r\nproblem for urban modeling. The large number of buildings and trees requires \r\ncheaper and more automatic approaches to be developed. Traditional \r\nscanner-based approaches require expensive equipments and can only capture \r\nunstructured 3D points without photometric appearance of the scenes, while \r\nmanual editing approaches require lots of man-power. Here, image-based modeling \r\nwhich can reconstruct the mathematical 3D representation of objects from images \r\nwith registered color texture map provides a tempting solution.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to traditional image-based modeling that relies on general \r\nsmoothness assumption of the reconstructed surface to automatic recover \r\nirregular surface meshes or requires fully manual editing to build up the \r\ncorrespondence among images to generate a regularized surface representation, \r\nin this thesis, we propose methods to make the process of creating regularized \r\nmesh models from images more easily. To accomplish this task, there are two \r\nchallenges. The first one is how to reconstruct unstructured 3D point clouds \r\nfrom large number of urban images robustly. The other one is how to turn \r\nunstructured 3D point clouds into regularized mesh models more easily.\r\n\r\nTo handle the first challenge, we describe a large scale quasi-dense structure \r\nfrom motion system. Based on hierarchical structure from motion, a resampling \r\nscheme is proposed to select dominant correspondences which yield a good \r\nreconstruction, while the quality of reconstruction is maintained as good as if \r\nall correspondences are involved. Therefore, even large scale reconstruction \r\ncan benefit from the robustness brought by the large number of propagated \r\nmatches of quasi-dense approaches.\r\n\r\nTo tackle the second challenge, we introduce prior knowledges into the modeling \r\nof trees and buildings to automate and ease the modeling process. To model \r\ntrees, we describe a system based on single image. Given a near orthogonal \r\nimage of a tree, as few as two strokes, one for marking a visible branch and \r\nthe other for marking the tree crown, are required to model a photo-realistic \r\ntree. The marked visible branches are used to guide a branch tracing algorithm \r\nto extract remaining visible branches automatically. The extracted visible \r\nbranches are used to construct a branch library which will later be grown using \r\na non-parametric growing algorithm under the constrain of the extracted tree \r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nTo reconstruct buildings, we propose a concept of unwrappable facades which \r\ngeneralizes the traditional concept of elevations to unwrappable surface. An \r\nunwrappable surface is a space surface defined by two orthogonal families of\r\nplanar curves, a horizontal base shape and a vertical profile. We first propose \r\na semi-automatic method to recover one single unwrappable facade which defines \r\nthe principal structure of a building. This is carried out through the recovery \r\nof its principal direction, its base shape and its profile from the input data. \r\nWe then propose an approximation approach that uses piecewise unwrappable \r\nsurfaces for the modeling of more general buildings. We finalize the model with \r\nglobal texture optimization and analysis. Also some interactive tools and image \r\nanalysis techniques are proposed to introduce any desired geometry details on \r\ntop of the principal structure of the building. The method has been validated \r\non a variety of buildings.\r\n\r\nTo deploy our image-based unwrappbale facade modeling at large scale, a crucial \r\nproblem is how to automatic partition the input data, including images and 3D \r\npoint clouds, into individual facades which are manageable for modeling. To \r\nsolve this problem, given an assumption that most of the facades are \r\nrectilinear, an automatic facade partition scheme that uses the natural \r\nvertical line on the building to partition is proposed. This scheme takes \r\nreconstructed 3D point clouds and 3D lines as input. The input data is first \r\nover-partitioned into sub-facades using reconstructed vertical 3D lines. Then 4 \r\nsuperior features, height of sub-facades, strip histogram, the number of \r\nintersections and edge response, are used to merge the sub-facades into \r\nmeaningful facades. After the partition, each facade can be regularized \r\nlocally, so that our former methods for modeling single facade can be applied. \r\nThe results of large scale reconstruction are also demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Monday, 18 April 2011\r\n\r\nTime:                   4:00pm - 6:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 2612A\r\n                         lifts 31/32\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Long Quan (Supervisor)\r\n                         Prof. Chi-Keung Tang (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Pedro Sander\r\n \t                Dr. Chiew-Lan Tai\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Image-based Urban Modeling"], "lenArticle": 766},

It emerges when scientist \r\nstudy the mathematical model of political institutions. Any society faces \r\nthe question of making compromise between people who have interest \r\nconflicts. And people develop political systems to solve these problems. \r\nFor example, in modern democratic societies, residents cast votes to elect \r\npolitical leaders and legislature, who are given the power to arbitrate \r\nthe compromise in the society. Although the interest of social choice \r\ntheory comes from these problems, once developed, this discipline applies \r\nnot only to the limited field. One of the areas it attracts attention from \r\nis computer science, especially multi-agent systems domain. In this survey \r\nwe'll introduce some preliminary insights social choice theory and \r\ncomputer science draws from each other.\r\n\r\nAs social choice theory considers the properties of all possible society, \r\nwe could imagine not much could be said to subscribe it. Actually most of \r\nthe fundamental results are impossibility theorem, saying what we can't \r\nget, rather than the properties of what we can get, from a society. Among \r\nthe many results in this field, Arrow's impossibility theorem is probably \r\nthe most famous one. This theorem states that there's no social choice \r\nfunction which satisfies 3 intuitive propositions, namely, Pareto \r\nOptimality, non-dictatorship and Independent of Irrelevant \r\nAlternatives(IIA).After discovery of this impossibility theorem, many \r\nother impossibility theorems were found out, giving us a deeper \r\nunderstanding of the dilemma in elections. In the Section 3 we'll have a \r\nbrief introduction of these impossibility theorems.\r\n\r\nThese complicated impossibility theorems are often big stones standing in \r\nfront of any novice willing to study social choice. The theorems \r\nthemselves are difficult to understand, let alone the even more subtle \r\nproof. To make a more readable proof and understanding, Tang and Lin \r\nintroduced how to use a computer to prove these theorems. Section 4 will \r\ninclude this and some other usage of computer to help solve problems in \r\nsocial choice theory.\r\n\r\nSocial choice theory applies not only to human society, but also to \r\nsituations when multiple agents need to make common decisions. Since \r\nmultiagent system was introduced to artificial intelligence community, \r\nsocial choice theory has drawn a lot of attention from computer \r\nscientists. In section 5, there will be some discussion about the \r\napplication of choice rules to multiagent systems.\r\n\r\nIn section 6, we'll introduce some practical applications of social choice \r\ntheory. After that, some conclusion will be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Wednesday, 20 April 2011\r\n\r\nTime:                   1:45pm - 3:45pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 1504\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Fangzhen Lin (Supervisor)\r\n                         Prof. Siu-Wing Cheng (Chairperson)\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\r\n  \t\t\tProf. Nevin Zhang\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["A Survey of Computational Social Choice: Theory and Applications"], "lenArticle": 460},

User Adaptation (i.e. personalization) and Domain Adaptation \r\nare two common problems on the Web. For example, for a recommender system like \r\nAmazon, it may need to provide personalized movie recommendations for a user \r\nbased his feedback from multiple domains including books and clothing. For a \r\nsearch engine like Google, it may need to serve personalized ads based on \r\nusers' browsing history. The quality of recommendations is one of the key \r\nfactors to the revenue for these service providers. Therefore, it is critical \r\nto provide high quality recommendations. However, this is challenging due the \r\nlimited information provided by the user.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, we consider the problem of using transfer learning to improve \r\nrecommendations. More specifically, we ask three questions. Firstly, how to \r\ntransfer knowledge across users or items? Secondly, how to transfer knowledge \r\nacross user groups or item domains? Thirdly, what models could be used to solve \r\nthe problems? To answer these questions, we propose a matrix factorization \r\nbased collaborative and transfer learning framework for solving the problems. \r\nWe discuss specific matrix factorization models that could handle user \r\nadaptation and domain adaptation separately. Furthermore, we propose a unified \r\nmodel that could handle them at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Friday, 29 April 2011\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Qiang Yang (Supervisor)\r\n                         Prof. Nevin Zhang (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. James Kwok\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Transfer Learning in Recommendations with Matrix Factorization Models"], "lenArticle": 263},

Several classical specific \r\nproblems were encountered during the first attempts on representation of action \r\neffects. This survey starts with describing these problems, Frame Problem, \r\nQualification Problem and Ramification Problem, and then follows two lines of \r\nresearch works (Lin's and McCain and Turner's) to see how researchers formalize \r\na dynamic reasoning system and represent the effects of actions to solve these \r\nproblems for reasoning.\r\n\r\nLin's work is based on situation calculus, which is first introduced by John \r\nMcCarthy in 1963 and then used by Reiter to solve the Frame Problem (successor \r\nstate axioms). Lin introduced a new fluent and corresponding method to embraced \r\ncausality, which plays a central role in commonsense reasoning about action, \r\nand successfully solved the Ramification Problem if the theory has no cycle in \r\ncausal dependency.

In applications, certain desirable properties of sequences \r\nare singled out to refer to randomness. On two important measures about \r\nrandomness of sequences are concentrated: one is the correlation, and the \r\nother is the linear complexity. Binary sequences are required to have the \r\nimpulse-like autocorrelation function, and such binary sequences have a \r\none-to-one correspondence to certain combinatorial designs. Besides, in \r\nfrequency hopping (FH) CDMA systems, the maximum Hamming correlation among \r\nthe FH sequences in the FH sequence set should meet some theoretical \r\nbounds. For all these sequences, large linear complexity is desirable for \r\nboth cryptographic and anti-jamming purposes.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, the linear complexity of a series of sequences with \r\ndesirable correlation is investigated. The thesis is composed of three \r\nmain parts. In the first part (Chapter 3), the first and only construction \r\nof binary sequences with the three-level autocorrelation values {-1, 3, N} \r\nis studied. Both the linear complexities and the minimal polynomials of \r\nbinary sequences obtained from two classes of difference sets with Singer \r\nparameters are explicitly determined. In the second part (Chapter 4), two \r\ninterleaving constructions of binary sequences with optimal \r\nautocorrelation of period N = 0 (mod 4) are investigated. General results \r\non the minimal polynomials of binary sequences generated by these two \r\nconstructions are given. The linear complexities of all the classes of \r\ngenerated sequences are established depending on those of binary sequences \r\nwith ideal autocorrelation. A close relation between the two constructions \r\nis also revealed. In the last part (Chapter 5), the linear complexities of \r\nthe FH sequences in several optimal sets are derived. Furthermore, the \r\nlinear complexities of the transformed FH sequences by applying a power \r\npermutation are determined. In order to construct optimal sets of FH \r\nsequences with large linear complexity, results on how to choose a proper \r\npower are given.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 16 May 2011\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3408\r\n \t\t\tLifts 17/18\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Christopher Leung (CIVL)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Cunsheng Ding (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Huamin Qu\r\n \t\t\tProf. Ke Yi\r\n                         Prof. Wai-Ho Mow (ECE)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Alexander Pott (Math., Otto-von-Guericke Univ.)\r\n                         Prof. Fangguo Zhang (Inf.

Data \r\nmanagement in mobile computing is a key research issue and has aroused much \r\nattention in the research community. Since users in mobile computing \r\nenvironments enjoy unrestricted mobility and ubiquitous information access, \r\nlocation information, both about the users and the data, is an important factor \r\nin data management. In this proposal, we propose several caching and query \r\nprocessing techniques for spatial queries in mobile networks. To enhance \r\nspatial query processing in mobile peer- to-peer networks (MP2PNs), we propose \r\na novel collaborative caching framework, namely, structure-embedded \r\ncollaborative caching (SECC), which allows a peer to query its neighboring \r\npeers progressively to build up the query result. We examine research issues on \r\nthe caching of index data, identification of the best peers for a query, result \r\nmerging and cache replacement. We further propose to examine a new type of \r\nspatial data, called bounded spatial datasets (BSDs), in which for some of the \r\nspatial objects only their bounding boxes are known. This allows different BSDs \r\nto represent the spatial objects in different levels of location granularity. \r\nWe study the properties of BSDs and propose several algorithms for querying \r\ndistributed BSDs.

As a result, data center networking has recently \r\nbeen a hot research topic in both academia and industry. A fundamental \r\nchallenge in this research is the design of the data center network that \r\ninterconnects the massive number of servers, and provides efficient and \r\nfault-tolerant routing service to upper-layer applications. In response to \r\nthis challenge, the research community have begun exploring novel \r\ninterconnect topologies. One approach is to use commodity switches or \r\nservers to scale out the network, such as Portland, VL2, DCell, BCube and \r\nFiConn. The other approach is to exploit optical devices to build \r\nhigh-capacity switches, such as Helios, HyPaC, PETASW, Data Vortex and \r\nOSMOSIS. Understandably, this research is still in its infancy. For the \r\nfirst approach, the proposed solutions either scale too fast (i.e., double \r\nexponentially) or too slow, suffer from performance bottlenecks, or can be \r\nquite costly. For the second approach, where the entire interconnection \r\nnetwork can be regarded as a \u201cgiant\u201d switch, its performance heavily \r\nrelies on well-designed packet buffers that support multiple queues, \r\nprovide large capacity and short response time.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, five different kinds of algorithms/architectures are \r\npresented, addressing on both of these issues respectively. Using \r\nsmall-port-count commodity switches, I propose two cost-effective and \r\ngracefully scalable Data Center Interconnects (DCIs) called Hyper-BCube \r\nand LacoNet that combine the advantages of both DCell and BCube \r\narchitectures while avoiding their limitations. On the other hand, aiming \r\nat scalable packet buffers, I propose three memory management algorithms \r\nalong with their architectures termed Radom-Round-Robin, distributed and \r\nhierarchical schemes. Preliminary experimental results show that these \r\nschemes can outperform the traditional algorithms significantly in terms \r\nof low time complexity, short access delay and guaranteed performance.\r\n\r\nMy future work will be carried out along following directions. First, I \r\nwill conduct more experiments and simulations to comprehensively evaluate \r\nthe performance of the proposed algorithms/architectures in different \r\nsettings and environments. Second, the fault-tolerant and load-balancing \r\nrouting algorithms for the proposed DCIs are still required to be further \r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Tuesday, 21 June 2011\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 4475\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Mounir Hamdi (Supervisor)\r\n                         Dr. Brahim Bensaou (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lin Gu\r\n \t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Interconnection Networks and Packet Buffer Architectures for Massive Data Centers"], "lenArticle": 395},

Since the 802.11 standards provide \r\nmultiple data rates for transmission but do not specify algorithms for \r\nautomatic rate selection, rate adaptation has been extensively used to \r\nmaximize system throughput by adjusting transmission rates dynamically \r\nbased on channel conditions. To the best of our knowledge, existing rate \r\nadaptation schemes mainly make use of packet statistics or signal \r\nstrengths of received packets to adapt transmission rates, regardless of \r\nthe priorities of packets.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we first find out that it is beneficial for rate \r\nadaptation schemes to consider the priorities of packets when adapting \r\ntransmission rates. We then propose a novel priority-based rate adaptation \r\nscheme named SRAG (Stackelberg Rate Adaptation Game) which jointly \r\nconsiders channel conditions and priorities of packets using game theory. \r\nSRAG focuses on vehicular networks where we can easily find a variety of \r\napplications with different priorities, such as file downloading, VoIP \r\n(Voice over IP), traffic querying, collision warning, etc. In SRAG, rate \r\nadaptation is modeled as a game for different priorities of users and each \r\nuser tries to select an optimal transmission rate that maximizes its \r\nutility regardless of others\u2019 utilities. SRAG adopts a Stackelberg game \r\nmodel to regulate behaviors of self-interested users and gives priority to \r\nhigh priority users in order to achieve better overall performance. \r\nExtensive ns-2 simulations demonstrate that SRAG can provide much better \r\nperformance for high priority users than existing rate adaptation schemes, \r\nwhile maintaining good performance for low priority users.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 23 June 2011\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t3:00pm \u2013 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 4483\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Mounir Hamdi (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lin Gu\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Priority-based Rate Adaptation Using Game Theory for Vehicular Networks"], "lenArticle": 305},

Such extremely \r\nlimited sample data obviously gives us terrible bias and inaccurate results. \r\nGiven one over ten thousand of the whole set of vehicles in a city, how can we \r\nstill retrieve the vehicle distribution and detect the hot spots/crowded areas \r\nin the city? The traditional density-based clustering methods work not well \r\nbecause of the very limited and errorable vehicle density/location information. \r\nHence we need new algorithms to handle such incomplete data, in terms of \r\naccuracy and scalability. On the other hand, the vehicle traces are typical \r\nspatio-temporal data, which requires efficient approaches. In this paper, we \r\nhave an interesting observation that the vehicle speed can indicate the \r\ncrowdedness of a given area. In other words, if a given area is very crowded, \r\nthen the vehicles\u2019 speed in this area is low; while if this area is not \r\ncrowded, then the vehicles\u2019 speed in this area prefers high. As such the \r\nmobility of samples is naturally incorporated and a novel non-density-based \r\nclustering method is developed, called mobility-based clustering. Several key \r\nfactors beyond the vehicle crowdedness have been identified and techniques to \r\ncompensate these effects are proposed. We evaluate the performance of \r\nmobility-based clustering based on real traffic situations. Experimental \r\nresults show that using 0.3 % of vehicles as the samples, mobility-based \r\nclustering can accurately identify hot spots which can hardly be obtained by \r\nthe latest representative algorithm UMicro.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Tuesday, 28 June 2011\r\n\r\nTime:                   3:30pm - 5:30pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 4483\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Lionel Ni (Supervisor)\r\n                         Prof. Shing-Chi Cheung (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Incomplete Data Analysis in Smart City Applications"], "lenArticle": 302},

The process of accurate\r\nregistration and segmentation of the images is crucial for accurate\r\ndiagnosis by clinical tools.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, image registration plays an important role in adding new\r\nvalues to images, e.g., combination of structural and functional\r\ninformation, disease diagnosis, statistical atlas model construction and\r\nso on. In this proposal, we first propose one novel intensity-based image\r\nregistration method. A new similarity metric derived from a physics model\r\nis designed for solving image registration problem. The proposed method,\r\nnamely registration with crystal dislocation energy, utilizes an elastic\r\ninteraction between the reference image and the moving image to drive the\r\nregistration process, which not only improves the registration accuracy,\r\nbut also provides a high convergence rate in the optimization procedure.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, image registration can also facilitate segmentation.\r\nDue to the low quality of medical brain images, it is not easy to rely on\r\nthe images alone to distinguish different brain structures, especially\r\nthose deep brain structures with weakly visible boundaries. Using a\r\npre-labeled atlas for segmenting target images is thus more preferable. In\r\nthe second part of this proposal, we propose two registration-based\r\nsegmentation methods. The first method explores the spatial dependency\r\nrelations among deep brain structures and builds a prior spatial\r\ndependency tree in order to constrain their inter-relationships and\r\ndetermine the structure-by-structure segmentation sequence. In the second\r\nmethod, a new concept, i.e., groupwise segmentation, which uses one atlas\r\nimage to segment a population of target images simultaneously, is proposed\r\nfor the first time. It is based upon a Markov Random Field (MRF) model to\r\nimpose the consistency constraints among the population of target images\r\nand to embed the prior shape information of the atlas. It is\r\nexperimentally demonstrated that the two proposed segmentation methods can\r\nachieve relatively higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Thursday, 30 June 2011\r\n\r\nTime:                   10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3588\r\n                         lifts 27/28\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Dr. Albert Chung (Supervisor)\r\n                         Prof. Long Quan (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Huamin Qu\r\n \t\t\tDr. Chiew-Lan Tai\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Fast physics model driven method for brain image registration and robust single atlas guided methods for registration-based brain image segmentation"], "lenArticle": 379},

Though the current wireless \r\ntechnologies have been developed rapidly, the intrinsic characteristics of \r\nwireless communication itself have largely limited its development in the near \r\nfuture. The interference caused by wireless\u2019s broadcast nature and its \r\nfragility due to the environment changes limit the transmission capacity and \r\nquality of today\u2019s wireless network. Thus accurately determining an instant \r\nwireless link quality is essential for most protocol and application designs \r\nand becomes a big challenge for the further development in wireless \r\ncommunications. In previous studies, packet-level metrics are utilized to \r\nreflect the link quality, e.g., Packet Reception Rate (PRR). In practice, \r\nhowever, these metrics exhibit many limitations and could be misleading without \r\nregarding the dynamics in wireless. Motivated by this, I propose to use more \r\nfine-grained information from the physical layer for link quality estimation \r\npurpose. Further inspired by the idea in Side Channel, the designated \r\ninterference patterns retrieved from physical layer can be used for encoding \r\nextra information without degrading the effective throughput of the original \r\ntransmission. However, this idea is currently only based on the coding \r\nredundancy in Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS). In order to realize it in \r\na more general scheme, i.e., OFDM-based WLANs, I then propose a new \r\ncommunication model, hJam that explores the physical layer information in an \r\nentirely different way. In hJam, the control messages in a multiple-user \r\nwireless network will be \u201cattached\u201d to the normal data transmission. hJam is \r\nimplemented on the GNU Radio testbed consisting of eight USRP2 nodes.

The existence of coherence, i.e. local data \r\nsimilarity, usually leads to redundancy of data and computations in virtually \r\nevery stage of the pipeline. By exploiting such coherence, we can potentially \r\nreduce a large amount of unnecessary computations. This not only has the \r\nbenefit of accelerating the process, but also provides opportunities to improve \r\nthe result quality with the additional data that are not available otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we introduce techniques for spatial and temporal data reuse \r\nthat benefit a number of real-time rendering and image-processing applications. \r\nFor simplicity and efficiency, we explore methods that operate in image space. \r\nMoreover, for all the applications, we seek to design parallel real-time \r\nalgorithms that executes on the GPU or multi-core CPU. This may limit the class \r\nof techniques that we can use, but the high efficiency can benefit a much wider \r\nrange of high-performance graphics applications.\r\n\r\nFor spatial data reuse, we first show how the results of interpolating sparse \r\nshading data on an image can be improved with an edge-preserving filter. We \r\nthen introduce a sampling scheme that accelerates the costly computation of \r\ndiffuse indirect illumination by allowing spatial data share. Moreover, in the \r\nfield of image processing, we demonstrate how data in coherent regions can be \r\nreused to fix antialiased edges that are damaged by non-linear filters. For \r\ntemporal data reuse, we introduce a few techniques and tools for improving the \r\nperformance of data reprojection -- a fundamental operation for temporal data \r\nreuse. We then propose a technique for effectively amortizing the computation \r\nof super sampling over time. This comes with a principled analysis of the \r\nquality associated with repeated reprojection.

Therefore, it is critical for them to provide \r\nhigh quality recommendations.\r\n\r\nHowever, the recommendation task is non-trivial. Learning problems in \r\nrecommendation usually are not well-defined traditional learning problems. \r\nIt is common that users would provide heterogeneous feedback on items from \r\nheterogeneous domains. For example, as a recommender system like Amazon, \r\nit may need to provide personalized movie recommendations for a user based \r\nher/his feedback from multiple domains including books and clothing. As a \r\nsearch engine like Google, it may need to serve personalized ads based on \r\nusers' searching behaviors and browsing history.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we consider the problems of using transfer-learning \r\ntechniques to improve recommendations. More specifically, we consider the \r\nproblems where we formulate multiple recommendation tasks in the problem \r\nand we ask three questions. Firstly, how to share knowledge when items \r\nspan over multiple heterogeneous domains? Secondly, how to share knowledge \r\nacross different user feedback? Thirdly, how to transfer knowledge with \r\nrespect to a particular recommendation task from other source tasks? To \r\nanswer these questions, we study transfer-learning based collaborative \r\nfiltering models that could handle heterogeneous feedback and domain \r\nadaptation.

The \r\ncontinuous growth of 3{D} models in public repositories has shifted \r\nresearchers' focus from computing local, low-level geometry features such \r\nas curvatures and textures to high-level semantic information such as \r\nshape parts information and shape structural characteristics (symmetry, \r\nparallelism, etc.). However, automatically computing these semantic \r\ninformation is essentially an ill-posed problem due to the ambiguities in \r\nthe definition of shape semantics.\r\n\r\nThis thesis focuses on developing interactive approaches to aid the shape \r\nanalysis process. We leverage the user assistance to exploit shape \r\nsemantics, and to respect and preserve them during manipulation. In \r\nparticular, this thesis aims at advancing the state-of-the-art interactive \r\ntechniques in two specific geometric applications: shape segmentation and \r\nshape manipulation.\r\n\r\nFirst, we introduce two interactive tools for shape segmentation, which we \r\ncall cross-boundary brushes and dot scissor. Both tools offer very simple \r\nand easy-to-use user interfaces that operate at interactive rates. In \r\ncontrast to the state-of-the-art interactive segmentation tools, our tools \r\nallow the user to cut out meaningful and functional components using only \r\na single mouse stroke or click near boundary regions in most cases, making \r\nthem very convenient to use. We adopt the concept of isolines of harmonic \r\nfields as cutting boundaries in designing both tools. We show that the \r\npropagation properties and the differentiating power of the harmonic \r\nfields allow effective computation of shape semantic boundaries for \r\nsegmentation purpose.\r\n\r\nSecond, we developed an editing framework that first extracts the shape \r\nstructural features and preserves them during user manipulation. In \r\ncontrast to traditional shape editing framework, the system operates at \r\nthe component level and takes shape structural characteristics such as \r\ninter-relations among semantic components as modeling constraints, \r\nenabling an effective structure-preserving editing tool. We show that user \r\nassistance is essential in accurately revealing the complex shape \r\nstructures. We use a semi-automatic shape segmentation process as a prior \r\nstep to facilitate the analysis of shape structures and inter-relations, \r\nand show that these shape analysis results play an important role in \r\npreserving the shape global features during user manipulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 3 August 2011\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 5508\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Andrew Poon (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Chiew-Lan Tai (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Huamin Qu\r\n \t\t\tProf. Long Quan\r\n                      \tProf. Kai Tang (MECH)\r\n                         Prof. Pheng-Ann Heng (Comp.

In \r\nurban areas, buildings and trees greatly affect the landscape of urban \r\nareas. How to reconstruct 3D models for buildings and trees is an \r\nimportant problem for urban modeling. The large number of buildings and \r\ntrees requires cheaper and more automatic approaches to be developed. \r\nTraditional scanner-based approaches require expensive equipment and can \r\nonly capture unstructured 3D points without photometric appearance of the \r\nscenes, while manual editing approaches require lots of man-power. Here, \r\nimage-based modeling which can reconstruct the mathematical 3D \r\nrepresentation of objects from images with registered color texture map \r\nprovides a tempting solution.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to traditional image-based building modeling that relies on \r\ngeneral smoothness assumption of the reconstructed surface to automatic \r\nrecover irregular surface meshes or requires fully manual editing to build \r\nup the correspondence among images to generate a regularized surface \r\nrepresentation, in this thesis, we target to create regularized 3D facade \r\nmodels with less user interactions. We propose methods to improve the key \r\naspects of existing work flow. First, a resampling scheme is proposed to \r\nselect dominant correspondences which yield a good result for large scale \r\nquasi-dense reconstruction as if all correspondences are involved. Then, \r\nto model single facade, we propose a concept of unwrappable facades which \r\ngeneralizes the traditional concept of elevations to unwrappable surface. \r\nThis representation enables us to model larger range of facades with a \r\nglobal shape description semi-automatically than previous methods do. This \r\nrepresentation further makes adding detailed decorations more easily and \r\nimage-based facade synthesis possible. Finally, we present a fa\u00e7ade \r\npartition scheme that use the natural vertical lines on the building to \r\nautomatically separate a large number of urban images and 3D point clouds \r\ninto the granularity of facade level. Automatic image-based facade \r\nmodeling becomes possible with our partition scheme.\r\n\r\nTo overcome the drawbacks of existing image-based tree modeling \r\ntechniques, e.g. lacks of complete multiple view data and tedious user \r\ninteraction on preprocessing, we describe a system to model a tree with \r\nsingle image. Given a near orthogonal image of a tree, as few as two \r\nstrokes, one for marking a visible branch and the other for marking the \r\ntree crown, are required to model a photo-realistic tree. The marked \r\nvisible branches are used to guide a branch tracing algorithm to extract \r\nremaining visible branches automatically. The extracted visible branches \r\nare used to construct a branch library which is later grown using a \r\nnon-parametric growing algorithm under the constraint of the extracted \r\ntree crown. We also demonstrate that additional information from multiple \r\nview images and laser scanner can be used to further eliminate this user \r\ninteraction with the help of joint segmentation and analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 5 August 2011\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3584\r\n \t\t\tLifts 27/28\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Yang Leng (MECH)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Long Quan (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Huamin Qu\r\n \t\t\tProf. Chiew-Lan Tai\r\n                         Prof. Kai Tang (MECH)\r\n                         Prof. Shing-Chow Chan (Elec. & Elec.

An effective failure clustering technique provides invaluable \r\nguidance to failure report analyses for both traditional applications and \r\ncontext-aware applications. Examples of these analyses include duplicate \r\nremoval, failure prioritization, and patch suggestion. Underpinning an \r\neffective clustering technique is properly designed failure proximity. Failure \r\nproximity for conventional applications has been well studied. However, no such \r\nstudy has been conducted on context-aware applications. Existing failure \r\nproximity techniques commonly assume that the execution profiles of failing \r\ntest runs due to different faults diverge. Unfortunately, this assumption does \r\nnot necessarily hold for context-aware applications, which react to a continual \r\ndata input stream capturing the contexts of their runtime environment.  We \r\nobserve that only a few segments of the input stream are failure-inducing. \r\nApplying failure proximity techniques to the whole input streams that lead to \r\nfailing test runs do not often result in significantly different execution \r\nprofiles when these test runs trigger different faults. In this thesis, we \r\npropose to perform failure clustering by applying failure proximity techniques \r\nonly to those failure-inducing segments. Our experiments show that our approach \r\ngreatly improved the accuracy of failure proximity for context-aware \r\napplications.

Such extremely limited sample data would obviously give \r\nus terrible bias and inaccurate results. In my work, I studied three real \r\napplications in smart city and proposed novel algorithms and methodology \r\nto tackle the incomplete data analysis problem. Application one: Given one \r\nover ten thousand of the whole set of vehicles in a city, how can we still \r\nretrieve the vehicle distribution and detect the hot spots or crowded \r\nareas in the city? The traditional density-based clustering methods work \r\nnot well because of the very limited and errorable vehicle density or \r\nlocation information. Hence we need new algorithms to handle such \r\nincomplete data, in terms of accuracy and scalability. On the other hand, \r\nthe vehicle traces are typical spatio-temporal data, which requires \r\nefficient approaches. In this paper, we have an interesting observation \r\nthat the vehicle speed can indicate the crowdedness of a given area. In \r\nother words, if a given area is very crowded, then the vehicles' speed in \r\nthis area is low; while if this area is not crowded, then the vehicles' \r\nspeed in this area prefers high. As such the mobility of samples is \r\nnaturally incorporated and a novel non-density-based clustering method is \r\ndeveloped, called mobility-based clustering. Several key factors beyond \r\nthe vehicle crowdedness have been identified and techniques to compensate \r\nthese effects are proposed. We evaluate the performance of mobility-based \r\nclustering based on real traffic situations. Experimental results show \r\nthat using 0.3 % of vehicles as the samples, mobility-based clustering can \r\naccurately identify hot spots which can hardly be obtained by the latest \r\nrepresentative algorithm UMicro. Application two: Given one over one \r\nhundred thousand of the whole set of population in a city, how can we \r\nstill retrieve the population distribution and detect the population \r\nbursts in the city? To address the difficulties of lacking real population \r\ndata, we take the advantage of mobile phone networks, which offer enormous \r\nspatiotemporal communication data among persons. More importantly, we find \r\nthe fact that we can utilize these mobile phone data to infer and \r\napproximate the population data. Thus, we can study the population burst \r\ndetection problem taking advantages of the unique features hidden in the \r\nmobile phone data. In this work, we present PBD, a system to conduct \r\nPopulation Burst Detection. First, we propose an effective clustering \r\nmethod, correlation-based clustering, to cluster the incomplete location \r\ninformation from the mobile phone data. Then, we design an adaptive \r\nparameter-free detection method, R-scan, to capture the distributed \r\ndynamic bursts. Finally, we devise an efficient algorithm, BT-miner, to \r\nretrieve burst trajectories. The experimental results on real life mobile \r\nphone data confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed \r\nalgorithms. Application three: We study a very interesting and practical \r\nproblem, pattern matching in a distributed mobile environment. Pattern \r\nmatching is a well-known problem and extensive research has been conducted \r\nfor performing effective and efficient search. However, previous \r\napproaches assume that data are centrally stored, which is not the case in \r\na mobile environment (e.g., mobile phone networks), where one person's \r\npattern could be separately stored in a number of different stations, and \r\nsuch a local pattern is incomplete compared with the global pattern. A \r\nsimple solution to pattern matching over a mobile environment is to \r\ncollect all the data distributed in base stations to a data center and \r\nconduct pattern matching at the data center afterwards. Clearly, such a \r\nsimple solution will raise huge amount of communication cost, which may \r\ncause the traffic congestion brought by the limited wireless bandwidth to \r\nbe even worse. Therefore, a communication efficient and search effective \r\nsolution is necessary. In this work, we propose a novel solution based on \r\na well-designed Weighted Bloom Filter (WBF), called, Distributed \r\nIncomplete pattern matching (DI-matching), to find target patterns over a \r\ndistributed mobile environment. Specifically, to save communication cost \r\nand ensure pattern matching in distributed incomplete patterns, we use WBF \r\nto encode a query pattern and disseminate the encoded data to each base \r\nstation. Each base station conducts a local pattern search according to \r\nthe received WBF. Only qualified IDs and corresponding weights in each \r\nbase station are sent to the data center for aggregation and verification. \r\nThrough non-trivial theoretical analysis and extensive empirical \r\nexperiments on a real city-scale mobile networks data set, we demonstrate \r\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 18 August 2011\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t3:00pm \u2013 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Hong-Kam Lo (CIVL)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Lionel Ni (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Lei Chen\r\n \t\t\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung\r\n \t\t\tProf. Guohua Chen (CBME)\r\n                         Prof. Xiaohua Jia (Comp.

Because \r\nrouting and channel decisions are coupled tightly, they need to be jointly \r\noptimized to achieve the highest performance. This is the so-called \r\nrouting and channel assignment (RCA) problem, which is known to be \r\nNP-hard. Most previous approaches addressing the problem either are \r\ncentralized in nature or consider routing and channel decisions \r\nseparately. There has been insufficient consideration on distributed and \r\njoint RCA optimization which takes into account of traffic demand in the \r\nnetwork. In this thesis, we propose and study CRAG (Channel and Routing \r\nAssignment based on Game) for MRMC WMN. CRAG is game-based, simple, \r\ndistributed and highly effective. CRAG achieves high performance because \r\nit jointly optimizes routing and channel assignment by using a properly \r\ndesigned payoff function to maximize the throughput given the traffic of \r\nthe network. CRAG is computationally efficient and fully implementable, \r\nand provably converges.

Data \r\nmanagement in mobile computing is a key research issue and has aroused much \r\nattention in the research community. Since users in mobile computing \r\nenvironments enjoy unrestricted mobility and ubiquitous information access, \r\nlocation information, both about the users and the data, is an important factor \r\nto consider in data management. In this thesis, we develop several caching and \r\nquery processing techniques for spatial queries in mobile networks. To enhance \r\nspatial query processing in mobile peer-to-peer networks (MP2PNs), we propose a \r\nnovel collaborative caching framework, namely, structure-embedded collaborative \r\ncaching (SECC), which allows a peer to query its neighboring peers \r\nprogressively to build up the query result. We examine research issues on the \r\ncaching of index data, identification of the best peers for a query, result \r\nmerging and cache replacement. We further investigate a new type of spatial \r\ndata, called bounded spatial datasets (BSDs), in which some of the spatial \r\nobjects only have known bounding boxes but not known exact positions. This \r\nallows different BSDs to represent the spatial objects in different levels of \r\nlocation granularity. We study the properties of BSDs and propose several \r\nalgorithms for querying distributed BSDs.

With the development of semantic web, RDF \r\ndata integrated from many sources become larger and larger. Because of its \r\nlarge amount and free schema, the efficiency of RDF data processing still \r\nremains a major challenge in the RDF data management. Many research works have \r\nbeen carried out to issue this problem. The idea of property table tries to \r\ndiscover the correlation among the predicates and stores the related date in \r\nthe same table so that query processing could be executed in the way just as we \r\ndo in the relational database. Column store focuses on each individual \r\npredicate. It partitions the RDF data into different tables based on the \r\ncorresponding predicates and builds the indices for each table. RDF-3X, a \r\nRISC-style engine to manage the RDF data efficiently, keeps the original triple \r\nformat of RDF data and store them directly and builds all possible permutation \r\nof indices.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we step further to discover potential properties of RDF data \r\nand make full use of them to process queries efficiently. To be more specified, \r\nwe introduce 1) Two linkage structures: star linkage and chain linkage. We \r\nextract this structure information, store it separately and build the \r\naggregated indices on it. 2) For the data which doesn't contain structure \r\ninformation, we store it in different tables based on the predicate, which is \r\nsimilar to column store. However, the big difference between our storage and \r\nthe column store is that we treat the predicates not equally. We observe that \r\nthere are some predicates which are multiple value predicates. For this kind of \r\npredicates,instead of using B+ tree index,  we use a local bitmap index which \r\nis more suitable for it and improve the query performance. 3) In order to gain \r\na query plan with high performance, we introduce a more complex and more \r\naccurate selectivity estimation which actually doesn't need extra time cost \r\ncompared with the traditional estimation. We evaluate our approach over two \r\ndifferent RDF datasets, Billion Triple Challenge and Yago, and develop \r\ndifferent kinds of possible queries. Compared with RDF-3X and monetDB, the \r\nperformance of our approach is better, especially for some queries with star \r\nlinkage or chain linkage information.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 24 August 2011\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 5509\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Lei Chen (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Charles Zhang\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["A Novel Scalable Join Processor over Large RDF Graphs with Linkage Information Aware"], "lenArticle": 429},

It serves as a pre-processing step for \r\nmany applications such as shape retrieval, skeleton extraction, texture \r\nmapping and shape matching. Fully automatic segmentation is still a hard \r\nproblem as the results may not be consistent with user intention. Thus \r\ninteractive segmentation remains an interesting topic.

These methods \r\nrequire either multiple in-segment strokes or on/cross-boundary stroke \r\nwith careful user attention.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we propose a novel and intuitive click tool for mesh \r\nsegmentation. Our tool computes a cut using only click locations without a \r\ncut direction. The cut direction is automatically determined through a \r\nwell-designed isoline selection scheme. Candidate cutting boundaries are \r\nisolines of harmonic fields. Our scheme selects the best isoline as the \r\ncutting boundary. The segmentation results are always smooth and \r\ninsensitive to noise and tessellation and require no post-processing. To \r\nallow more user control, we design an optional cut refinement method that \r\nis also driven by clicks. The cut can be refined to pass through more \r\nlocations specified by clicks.

As a \r\nconsequence, only very limited labeled data is available for model training, \r\nleading to the so-called labeled data deficiency problem.  In the machine \r\nlearning research community, several directions have been pursued to address \r\nthis problem. Among these efforts, a promising direction is multi-task learning \r\nwhich is a learning paradigm that seeks to boost the generalization performance \r\nof a model on a learning task with the help of some other related tasks. This \r\nlearning paradigm has been inspired by human learning activities in that people \r\noften apply the knowledge gained from previous learning tasks to help learn a \r\nnew task more efficiently and effectively. Of the several approaches proposed \r\nin previous research for multi-task learning, a relatively less studied yet \r\nvery promising approach is based on automatically learning the relationships \r\namong tasks from data.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we first propose a powerful probabilistic framework for \r\nmulti-task learning based on the task relationship learning approach. The main \r\nnovelty of our framework lies in the use of a matrix variate prior with \r\nparameters that model task relationships. Based on this general multi-task \r\nlearning framework, we then propose four specific methods, namely, multi-task \r\nrelationship learning (MTRL), multi-task generalized t process (MTGTP), \r\nmulti-task high-order task relationship learning (MTHOL), and probabilistic \r\nmulti-task feature selection (PMTFS). By utilizing a matrix variate normal \r\ndistribution as a prior on the model parameters of all tasks, MTRL can be \r\nformulated efficiently as a convex optimization problem. On the other hand, \r\nMTGTP is a Bayesian method that models the task covariance matrix as a random \r\nmatrix with an inverse-Wishart prior and integrates it out to achieve Bayesian \r\nmodel averaging to improve generalization performance. With MTRL as a base, \r\nMTHOL provides a generalization that learns high-order task relationships and \r\nthe model parameters. Unlike MTRL, MTGTP and MTHOL which are for standard \r\nmulti-task classification or regression problems, PMTFS addresses the feature \r\nselection problem under the multi-task setting by incorporating the learning of \r\ntask relationships. Besides conducting experimental validation of the proposed \r\nmethods on several data sets for multi-task learning, we also investigate in \r\ndetail a collaborative filtering application under the multi-task setting. \r\nThrough both theoretical and empirical studies on the several methods proposed, \r\nwe show that task relationship learning is a very promising approach for \r\nmulti-task learning and related learning problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 29 August 2011\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Danny Tsang (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dit-YanYeung (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Qiang Yang\r\n \t\t\tProf. Nevin Zhang\r\n \t\t\tProf. Mike So (ISOM)\r\n                      \tProf. Eric P.

As the technology and application of\r\nrecommendation is rapidly evolving in these years, traditional\r\ncollaborative filtering algorithms such as nearest neighbor or matrix\r\nfactorization have fallen short in coping with several emerging but\r\ncritical issues in modern systems. Firstly, ranking items, especially\r\nidentifying a few most interesting items out of a huge pool, has\r\nbecome the core task in most application scenarios. However,\r\ntraditional algorithms focus on doing regression on the observed user\r\nratings (i.e., explicit user feedback), which is a detour towards the\r\nend goal of ranking. In this work, we propose a new framework for\r\ndirectly solving the personalized ranking problem by representing user\r\nfeedback using pairwise preference based representation. Secondly,\r\nmodern systems collect user feedback in more diverse forms(e.g.,\r\nrating, click, browse, purchases) whereas existing methods only handle\r\nexplicit feedback. To cope with data sparsity, it is necessary to\r\nintegrate multiple sources of information. In this work, we show that\r\nranking models are also an effective way to unify the heterogeneous\r\nrepresentations of different forms of user feedback. Finally,\r\ntraditional recommendation algorithms do not take into account\r\ncontextual factors such as time, location and social networks, which\r\nare nevertheless very important as recommender systems are becoming\r\npart of people's daily life and being accessed on both desktop and\r\nmobile platforms. We therefore also try to develop recommendation\r\nmodels that could incorporate time and social network information.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:                   Wednesday, 31 August 2011\r\n\r\nTime:                   1:00pm - 3:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:      Prof. Qiang Yang (Supervisor)\r\n                         Dr. Sunghun Kim (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dik-Lun Lee\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Ranking Oriented Algorithms for Context Aware Recommendation"], "lenArticle": 332},

Nevertheless, many realistic problems could not be envisioned \r\nwhen the architecture was first designed. Today, enterprises, carriers, and \r\nother service providers are all facing an ordeal: the network is becoming the \r\nmost complex and complicated system ever. The make-do-and-amend strategy has \r\nmade the network architecture ill-suited to management, extension, and \r\ninnovation.\r\n\r\nSoftware defined networking (SDN) has recently been proposed to address the \r\nabove issues. Unlike conventional L2/L3 devices, where the control logic is \r\nmingled with data forwarding, SDN decouples them apart. In general, SDN \r\nabstracts three conceptual entities, data plane, control plane, and application \r\nplane. Data plane consists of network elements, such as switches and routers. \r\nControl plane is logically the center where network status is stored, and from \r\nit control commands are issued to the data plane. Network applications, such as \r\ntraffic engineering, load balancer and firewall, consult the control plane for \r\nnetwork status and rely on the control plane to alter the network. Based on its \r\ndecoupled network abstraction, SDN strives to increase the flexibility and \r\nprogrammability of the network. Therefore, network management can be automated, \r\nsecurity policy can be enforced without hassle and network traffic can be \r\ncontrolled at finer granularity.\r\n\r\nIn this survey, we first present an overview of SDN. We then procceed to \r\nanalyze the data, control and application plane of SDN in detail. Critical \r\nissues of each plane will be discussed respectively. Finally, we discuss some \r\nfuture concerns of SDN before we conclude this survey.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 2 February 2015\r\n\r\nTime:                  \t3:00pm - 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3494\r\n                         Lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Bo Li (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Kai Chen\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lin Gu\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["A survey on software defined network"], "lenArticle": 302},

To obtain a target layout, typically the user needs to\r\nperform a series of manual operations, such as selecting, resizing\r\nand positioning. This process gives the user full control of the\r\nfinal layout, while it is tedious and error-prone, especially when\r\nthe target layout is complex.\r\n\r\nThis thesis focuses on developing interactive techniques to\r\nfacilitate the process of creating or editing the layout of graphic\r\nelements. We introduce three interactive techniques to improve the\r\nuser's performance. With these techniques, the user may perform the\r\nselection and manipulation operations easier and more efficiently.\r\n\r\nFirst, we introduce a new selection tool called Lazy Selection. It\r\nis a scribble-based tool for quick selection of one or more desired\r\nshape elements by roughly stroking through the elements. Our\r\nalgorithm automatically refines the selection and reveals the user's\r\nintention. It first extracts selection candidates from the\r\nscribble-covered elements by examining the underlying patterns and\r\nthen ranks them based on their location and shape with respect to\r\nthe user-sketched scribble. Such a design makes this tool tolerant\r\nto imprecise input systems and applicable to touch systems without\r\nsuffering from the fat finger problem.\r\n\r\nSecond, we present GACA, a group-aware command-based arrangement\r\ntool. Compared with the traditional command-based arrangement tools,\r\nit reduces the numbers of selection operation and command\r\ninvocation. The key idea is that an issued arrangement command is in\r\nfact very informative, instructing how to automatically decompose a\r\n2D layout into multiple 1D groups. each of which is compatible with\r\nthe command. We present a parameter-free, command-driven grouping\r\napproach so that users can easily predict our grouping results. We\r\nalso design a simple user interface to enable explicit control of\r\ngrouping and arrangement.\r\n\r\nThird, we present a framework for automatic global beautification of\r\nlayouts. To facilitate ambiguity resolution in layout\r\nbeautification, we present a novel user interface for visualizing\r\nand editing inferred relationships. First, our interface provides a\r\npreview of the beautified layout with inferred constraints, without\r\ndirectly modifying the input layout. In this way, the user can\r\neasily keep refining beautification results by interactively\r\nrepositioning and/or resizing elements in the input layout. Second,\r\nwe present a gestural interface for editing automatically inferred\r\nconstraints by directly interacting with the visualized constraints\r\nvia simple gestures.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 19 September 2014\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Chiew-Lan Tai (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Huamin Qu (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Chi-Shing Chung\r\n \t\t\tProf. Long Quan\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Interaction Techniques for Layout Editing of Graphic Elements"], "lenArticle": 446},

It is widely applied to analyze the functionalities and \r\nevolutionary relationships of proteins. With the rapid growth of new 3D protein \r\nstructures and the further development of protein research work, protein \r\nstructural alignment becomes more and more important in this field.\r\n\r\nCompared with different structural alignment tools, DALIX is the one capable of \r\ncalculating an optimal structural alignment based on DALI score. It outperforms \r\nDALI, one of the most popular structural alignment algorithms, in most cases \r\nwhen aligning relatively short proteins. However, DALIX has high time \r\ncomplexity, which restricts its practical application.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we design parallel versions of DALIX to accelerate it. We \r\nimplement a coarse-grained parallel algorithm using OPENMP on multicore-CPUs \r\nplatforms and also a fine-grained parallel algorithm using CUDA on GPUs. In \r\nboth versions, we parallelize the following components of DALIX: 1) Computation \r\nof the DALI score array, 2) algorithm engineering, 3) 2-level dynamic \r\nprogramming and 4) updating of the Lagrangian multipliers. In particular, to \r\nbetter utilize the massive GPU thread parallelism, in the CUDA version of \r\nDALIX, we design a 2-level parallel algorithm for the 2-level dynamic \r\nprogramming procedure. We compact the decision table of dynamic programming so \r\nthat it can fit into the shared memory for inter thread communication, which \r\nimproves the performance. We have compared the two parallel algorithms with the \r\nserial version of DALIX on a set of protein alignments. The CUDA version is run \r\non an NVIDIA GTX960 GPU while the OPENMP version and the serial version are \r\nexecuted on a platform equipped with 2 Intel Xeon E5620 CPUs. The results show \r\nthat the CUDA version outperforms the serial version with a speedup ranging \r\nfrom 5.5x to 20x. The OPENMP version also has a speedup of around 7x.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 2 June 2016\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:30am - 12:30pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 5506\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Qiong Luo (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Nevin Zhang (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Weichuan Yu (ECE)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["ACCELERATING PROTEIN STRUCTURE ALIGNMENT WITH MULTICORE-CPUS AND GRAPHIC PROCESSORS"], "lenArticle": 363},

Current mainstream solutions rely on Received Signal \r\nStrength (RSS) of wireless signals as fingerprints to distinguish and \r\ninfer locations. However, those methods suffer from fingerprint ambiguity \r\nthat roots in multipath fading and temporal dynamics of wireless signals, \r\nwhich invalidate theoretical propagation models, distort received signal \r\nsignatures, and fundamentally constrain the performance of indoor \r\nlocalization. With the trend moving towards equipment of smart devices in \r\ndaily life and adoption of enhanced sensors, we identify the opportunity \r\nof ubiquitous indoor localization service via the multi-modal sensing \r\nabilities on smartphones. In the first work, we propose Argus, an \r\nimage-assisted localization system for mobile devices by harnessing their \r\nVisual Sensing abilities. The basic idea of Argus is to extract geometric \r\nconstraints from crowdsourced photos, and to reduce fingerprint ambiguity \r\nby mapping the constraints jointly against the fingerprint space. In the \r\nsecond work, we design TUM, an Acoustic Sensing localization scheme \r\nTowards Ubiquitous Multi-device localization. The basic idea of TUM is to \r\nutilize the dual-microphones and speakers to obtain distance cues among \r\ndevices, while resolving the localization ambiguity with the help of MEMS \r\nsensors. In the third work, we exploit the Inertial Sensing abilities on \r\nsmartphones and propose RAD. The basic idea is to automatically generate a \r\nfingerprint database through space partition, of which each cell is \r\nfingerprinted by its maximum influence APs. Based on this robust location \r\nindicator, fine-grained localization can be achieved by a discretized \r\nparticle filter utilizing sensor data fusion. We prototype the above three \r\nschemes with commodity devices, and evaluate their performances in various \r\nindoor environments. Experimental results demonstrate improved indoor \r\nlocalization accuracy, better user interaction and less overhead compared \r\nwith classical RSS-based schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 2 June 2016\r\n\r\nTime:                  \t1:00pm - 3:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 5506\r\n                         (lifts 25/26)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Ke Yi (Supervisor)\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Gary Chan\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["TOWARDS UBIQUITOUS INDOOR LOCALIZATION SERVICE VIA MULTI-MODAL SENSING ON SMARTPHONES"], "lenArticle": 353},

The problem \r\nfinds applications in route planning, nearest neighbor search, traffic analysis \r\nor social networks but also in other research fields such as mathematics, \r\noperational research and transportation engineering to name a few. Although the \r\nshortest path problem is considered to be one of the most famous in computer \r\nscience for more than 50 years, today novel routing algorithms for \r\ntransportation networks emerge, mainly because of the fast development of \r\nnavigation systems and also the rising proliferation of sensors and mobile \r\ndevices that are able to provide a vast majority of trajectory data. The \r\nincreasing demand on location based services has resulted in greater need for \r\nefficient solutions evolving the problem from finding Shortest Paths on Road \r\nNetworks to finding Fastest Paths, capturing the time dependency across the \r\nlinks of the road network.\r\n\r\nIn this work we survey the most important techniques that solve these problems \r\nefficiently. We provide a brief introduction to the static setting and focus on \r\ntwo different settings, the time dependent and the stochastic formulation of \r\nthe problem. The static setting assumes constant edge costs. On the other hand, \r\nthe time dependent model captures changes in the network, such as traffic \r\ncongestion, by assigning functions of time as edge costs. While routing \r\ntime-dependently provides more accurate results than the static approach, it \r\ndoes not take into account the uncertain events that can influence the travel \r\ntimes of the different links in a road network. So we present the stochastic \r\nsetting of the shortest path problem, where links are formulated as random \r\nvariables, a setting that can capture the uncertainty of the network more \r\neffectively and thus leading to more accurate solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 16 February 2016\r\n\r\nTime:                  \t3:00pm - 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 1504\r\n                         Lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dimitris Papadias (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Wilfred Ng (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Fastest Paths and Stochastic Routing in Road Networks: A Survey"], "lenArticle": 355},

Listeners perceive strong \r\nemotions in music, and composers can create emotion-driven music. Researchers \r\nhave given more and more attention to this area because of the many \r\napplications such as emotion-based music searching and automatic soundtrack \r\nmatching. These applications have motivated research on the correlation between \r\nmusic features such as timbre and emotion perception. Machine recognition \r\nmethods for music emotion have also been developed for automatically ective \r\nmusical content so that it can be indexed and retrieved in large scale based on \r\nemotion.\r\n\r\nIn this research, our goal is to enable machine to automatically recognize \r\nmusic emotion. Therefore, we focus on two major topics: 1) understand the \r\ncorrelation between music emotion and timbre, 2) design algorithms for \r\nautomatic music emotion recognition.\r\n\r\nTo understand the correlation between music emotion and timbre, we designed \r\nlistening tests to compare sounds from eight wind and bowed string instruments. \r\nWe wanted to know if some sounds were consistently perceived as being happier \r\nor sadder in pairwise comparisons, and which spectral features were most \r\nimportant aside from spectral centroid. Therefore, we conducted listening tests \r\nof normal sounds, centroid-equalized sounds, as well as static sounds. Our \r\nresults showed strong emotional predispositions for each instrument, and that \r\nthe even/odd harmonic ratio is perhaps the most salient timbral feature after \r\nattack time and brightness.\r\n\r\nTo design algorithms for automatic music emotion recognition, we investigated \r\nmusic emotion's properties. We found that the major problem of automatic music \r\nemotion recognition is lack-of-data, which is due to 1) music emotion is \r\ngenre-specic, therefore labeled data for each music category is sparse; 2) \r\nmusic emotion is time-varying, and there is little time-varying labels for \r\nmusic emotion.

Thanks to \r\nvarious sensors equipped on devices such as smartphones and wearable devices, a \r\nwide range of human behaviour and context information can be obtained in real \r\ntime. These information can be further used to support a large number of mobile \r\napplications which bring great convenience to people\u2019s life, such as vehicle \r\nnavigation, location-based advertising and taxi-hailing. However, some topics \r\nremain hard to be solved. In this thesis, we first propose a mobile sensing \r\napplication : urban taxi-sharing. Then we address two challenging problems for \r\npractical mobile applications: privacy leakage and cold-start problem.\r\n\r\nIn the first work, we design a QoS-aware taxi-sharing system named QA-Share. \r\nQA-Share allows occupied taxis to pick up new passengers on the fly, promising \r\nto reduce waiting time for taxi riders and increase productivity for drivers. \r\nTaxi-sharing can also bring significant social and environmental benefits, such \r\nas relieving traffic jams and saving energy consumption. We address two \r\nimportant challenges. First, QA-Share aims to maximize driver profit and user \r\nexperience at the same time. Second, QA-Share continuously optimizes these two \r\nmetrics by dynamically adapting its schedule as new requests arrive, without \r\nentering an oscillation state.\r\n\r\nMost mobile sensing applications rely on the sensing information shared by the \r\ncrowd. Meanwhile, it has raised concerns for location privacy. Users may wish \r\nto prevent privacy leak and publish as many non-sensitive contexts as possible \r\nfor better user experience of the application. Simply suppressing sensitive \r\ncontexts is vulnerable to the adversaries exploiting spatio-temporal \r\ncorrelations in users\u2019 behaviour. In the second work, we present a novel data \r\nsharing scheme PLP, which preserves privacy while maximizes the amount of data \r\ncollection by filtering a user\u2019s context stream. The experimental results show \r\nthat PLP efficiently protects privacy without sacrificing much utility.\r\n\r\nMany context sensing methods are achieved by learning the relationship between \r\ncontext information and original sensing data of smartphones. However, manually \r\nlabeling samples collected from smartphone users is time-consuming, \r\nlabor-intensive and money-consuming. It\u2019s hard to collect enough labeled \r\nsamples at first. This is also known as the cold-start problem. In the third \r\nwork, we propose iSelf, which can predict context information in cold-start \r\nconditions with smartphones. We take emotion detection as an example and show \r\nthat our method can achieve high accuracy with only a few labeled samples.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:  \t\t\tFriday, 11 September 2015\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t9:00am - 11:00am\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3007\r\n \t\t\tLift 4\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Xiaonong Zhu (HUMA)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Lionel Ni (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Huamin Qu\r\n \t\t\tProf. Ke Yi\r\n \t\t\tProf. Zongjin Li (CIVL)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Jianping Wang (Comp.

GeoSNs have created a fertile ground for novel location-based social \ninteractions, advertising and market analysis. In this thesis we introduce: i) \na general framework for Geo-Social query processing, ii) GeoSN queries, which \nextract useful information combining both the social relationships and the \ncurrent location of the users, iii) Geo-Social Ranking (GSR) problem that ranks \nthe users based on their social and spatial attributes, and iv) Real-Time \nMulti-criteria Graph Partitioning (RMGP) task for partitioning the social graph \nof a GeoSN.\n\nInitially, we propose a general framework for Geo-Social query processing that \noffers flexible data management and algorithmic design. It segregates the \nsocial, geographical and query processing modules. Then, each GeoSN query is \nprocessed via a transparent combination of primitive queries issued to the \nsocial and geographical modules. We demonstrate the power of our framework by \nintroducing several \"basic\" and \"advanced\" query types, and devising various \nsolutions for each type.\n\nGSR ranks the users of a GeoSN based on their distance to a given query \nlocation q, the number of their friends in the vicinity of q, and possibly the \nconnectivity of those friends. We propose four GSR functions that assign scores \nin different ways: i) LC, which is a weighted linear combination of social \n(i.e., friendships) and spatial (i.e., distance to q) aspects, ii) RC, which is \na ratio combination of the two aspects, iii) HGS, which considers the number of \nfriends in coincident circles centered at q, and iv) GST, which takes into \naccount triangles of friends in the vicinity of q. We investigate the behavior \nof the functions, qualitatively assess their results, and study the effects of \ntheir parameters. Moreover, for each ranking function, we design a query \nprocessing technique that utilizes its specific characteristics to efficiently \nretrieve the top-k users.\n\nRMGP groups the users based on their social connectivity and their distance to \na set of input geographical points that represent the locations of social \nevents. We consider RMGP as an on-line graph partitioning task, which may be \nfrequently performed for different query parameters (e.g., social events). In \norder to overcome the serious performance issues associated with the large \nsocial graphs found in practice, we develop solutions based on a game theoretic \nframework. Specifically, we consider each user as a player, whose goal is to \nfind the class that optimizes his objective function. We propose algorithms \nbased on best-response dynamics and analyze their properties.\n\nFinally, we perform an exhaustive experimental evaluation for all proposed \nmethods with real and synthetic datasets in centralized and decentralized \nsettings.

Recent \r\nadvances of recommender systems benefits from the Collaborative Filtering (CF) \r\ntechniques, which are modeled on user-item ratings. With the huge and ever \r\nincreasing volume of various contextual information available, new scenarios \r\nfor recommendations are emerging that offer new information going beyond \r\nuser-item ratings. In many applications, it is important to incorporate the \r\ncontextual information into the recommendation process. For example, using \r\nuser's location context, recommender system would provide a recommendation that \r\ncan be more useful than the one without considering such context.\r\n\r\nThe context in recommender systems can be divided into three categories in \r\nterms of its resource type: attribute context information associated with users \r\nand items, user-item interaction related to interplay of users and items \r\ndifferent from that encoded in rating matrix, and cross-domain context \r\nconcerning knowledge from different but related domain. In this survey, we \r\nfirst introduce CF tasks and two main categories of CF techniques: \r\nmemory-based, model-based. We then summarize and analyze recommendation \r\nscenarios involving contextual information and CF algorithms that have been \r\nrecently proposed to address such conditions.

In this thesis, we propose theoretically motivated \r\nsymbolic and distributed models for improvising lyrics in music and we choose \r\nthe genre of hip hop lyrics as our domain. Through our work, we model the \r\nissues in song lyric improvisation using modern statistical language \r\ntechnologies and attempt to bridge the gap between language and music in \r\nnatural language processing (NLP).\r\n\r\nFirstly, we describe a novel hidden Markov Model (HMM) based rhyme scheme \r\ndetection module which identifies the rhyming scheme within a given stanza in a \r\ncompletely unsupervised fashion without using any linguistic or phonetic \r\nfeatures. We use this rhyme scheme detection module to select the training data \r\nfor our improvisation models so as to generate fluent and rhyming output and \r\ndemonstrate that using the rhyme scheme detection module improves the model \r\nperformance considerably.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we improvise hip hop lyrics by generating responses to challenges \r\nsimilar to a freestyle rap battle. We model the problem of improvisation as a \r\nmachine translation problem where the challenge needs to be \u201ctranslated\u201d into a \r\nresponse and train a bottom-up token based inversion transduction grammar model \r\nto perform the transduction. We also propose a search heuristic in our decoding \r\nalgorithm and disfluency handling strategies to improve our model output. We \r\ncontrast our model with an off-the-shelf phrase based SMT (PBSMT) model and \r\nshow that our model generates significantly better responses that are more \r\nfluent and rhyme better with the challenges.\r\n\r\nWe also propose a novel model that improvises rhyming and fluent responses for \r\na hip hop lyric challenge by combining both bottom-up token based rule \r\ninduction and top-down rule segmentation strategies to learn a stochastic \r\ntransduction grammar. We demonstrate that the combined token based and rule \r\nsegmentation induction method performs better than the bottom-up token based \r\ninversion transduction grammar model. We also show good model performance on \r\nMaghrebi French hip hop lyrics demonstrating the language independence of our \r\nmodels.\r\n\r\nAnother improvisation algorithm using TRAAM, a fully bilingual generalization \r\nof Pollack\u2019s (1990) monolingual Recursive Auto-Associative Memory neural \r\nnetwork model, in which each distributed vector represents a bilingual \r\nconstituent is also presented. TRAAM models capture cross-lingual \r\ngeneralizations via soft bilingual categories and hence have attractive \r\nproperties which can be used for the tasks such as bilingual grammar induction \r\nand statistical machine translation approaches. Using a novel pattern \r\ncompletion decoding algorithm, we use a trained TRAAM model to improvise hip \r\nhop lyrics.\r\n\r\nLastly, we discuss the challenges in evaluating the performance on the \r\nimprovisation task of evaluating hip hop lyrics as a first step toward \r\ndesigning robust evaluation strategies for improvisation tasks, a relatively \r\nneglected area to date. We discuss our observations regarding inter-evaluator \r\nagreement on judging improvisation quality as a means to better understand the \r\nhigh degree of subjectivity at play in improvisation tasks, thereby enabling \r\nthe design of more discriminative evaluation strategies to drive future model \r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:  \t\t\tThursday, 26 November 2015\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t11:00am - 1:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 4475\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Huai Liang Chang (MATH)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dekai Wu (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Andrew Horner\r\n \t\t\tProf. Xiaojuan Ma\r\n \t\t\tProf. Pascale Fung (ECE)\r\n \t\t\tProf. David Johnston (CityU)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["IMPROVISING HIP HOP LYRICS VIA TRANSDUCTION GRAMMAR INDUCTION"], "lenArticle": 591},

Theoretical research on interplays between \r\nalgebra error-correcting code and combinatoric t-design began to thrive from \r\n1970s. The first breakthrough in generating designs from linear codes was the \r\nAssmus-Mattson theorem. After revealing\u00a0Z4 forms of the Kerdock and Preparata \r\ncodes , research was also loaded on designs from Z4 codes. An analogue of \r\nAssmus-Mattson theorem in the Z4 case was also\u00a0developed in 2010.\r\n\r\nAnalysis on linear codes from incidence matrices of designs became abundant in \r\n1 990s.

Sensing via WiFi enables remote sensing without \r\nwearable sensors and contactless sensing in privacy-preserving mode, which \r\nare beneficial in various applications including security surveillance, \r\nintrusion detection, elderly monitoring, and human-computer interaction. \r\nFor WiFi sensing to excel indoors, multipath propagation acts as a major \r\nconcern. The multipath effect can invalidate theoretical propagation \r\nmodels, distort received signal signatures, and constrain the performance \r\nof wireless sensing even when inferring the presence of humans. To \r\nexplicitly eliminate any adverse impact of multipath propagation, \r\nresearchers resort to customized signals and specialized software-defined \r\nradios for radar signal processing. To enable device-free applications on \r\ncommodity infrastructures, existing approaches exploit a dense deployment \r\nof wireless links.\r\n\r\nInstead of avoiding multipath, in this thesis, we demonstrate it is \r\npossible to harness multipath in WiFi sensing with the PHY layer Channel \r\nState Information (CSI). First, we design a primitive to identify the \r\navailability of the LOS path under multipath propagation with only \r\ncommodityWiFi devices to improve the multipath awareness in WiFi sensing. \r\nSecond, we exploit the rich multipath effect as fingerprints to blur the \r\ndirectional coverage of traditional passive human detection architecture \r\nto achieve omnidirectional coverage. Third, we propose a measurable metric \r\nas proxy for detection sensitivity and a lightweight subcarrier and path \r\nconfiguration scheme to adapt to different multipath propagation \r\nconditions.

That \r\nhelp busimnesses and organizations to access complex and expensive IT \r\nfacilities offered by the cloud service provider (CSP) without large up-front \r\ninvestment to establish their own IT infrastructure. Recently large investments \r\nhave been made in cloud datacenters impacting business models to be based on \r\nits cost benefits. Much research has been focused on various economic issues in \r\ncloud computing and datacenters such as, pricing models, cost-optimization \r\ntechniques, billing and chargeback model, and economic/business objectives. \r\nRelated to this context there has been a significant research aiming to \r\nminimise costs for cloud users however, less attention has been paid to address \r\nthe challenges faced by the cloud providers striving for revenue or profit \r\nmaximisation.\r\n\r\nOur literature survey focuses on the application of Revenue Management concepts \r\nin cloud computing environments, particularly on the \r\nInfrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) level with the prices offered are important \r\nfactors. Revenue Management deals with complex decision making process related \r\nto sales, market demand, and pricing strategies of services from a CSP's \r\nperspective. The survey include, market and economics-inspired pricing \r\nstrategies, mechanisms and algorithms to address the profit/revenue \r\nmaximization problem of CSPs. Two types of CSPs are considered: 1) Single cloud \r\nprovider model where a CSP relies only on its own resources to serve the \r\nclients and 2) Mutiple cloud provider model where a CSP participates in a cloud \r\nfederation to benefit from sharing resource sharing. Survey covers resource \r\nprovisioning policies, capacity control mechanisms, dynamic pricing methoids, \r\nauctions bidding strategies for profit maximization bothe in a single monopoly \r\ncloud market as well as in a cloud federation with multiple cloud with \r\ncompetetion and cooperation among CSPs. Consumers perspective also became \r\nimportant where, consumers seem to prefer a well-known cloud service platform \r\ninstead of comparing the price/availability rate of different CSPs or between \r\nthe services of a single CSP and then choosing the cheapest. Consumers have \r\nvarious cloud resource/service requirements depending on their business, and \r\nCSPs with limited resource capacities/flexibilities face challenge of how to \r\nsell their resources/services efficiently. To address distinctive consumer \r\npreferences, CSPs can offer numerous classes of services according to some SLA \r\nwhich are priced differently. The CSPs allocating their datacenter capacity to \r\nvarious types of consumers which may be incentivised to maximize its output and \r\ntotal revenue yielded. After knowing the consumers preferences and then \r\ndesigning the services accordingly, the CSP may face the challenge of how to \r\nset price for different services and how this pricing may impact the resource \r\nutilization. One dimension to this problem is how CSPs would make decision \r\nabout whether to accept or reject users requests for services when the \r\nresources become scarce.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 10 December 2015\r\n\r\nTime:                  \t2:30pm - 4:30pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 5508\r\n                         Lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Jogesh Muppala (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Brahim Bensaou (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Gary Chan\r\n \t\t\tDr. Wei Wang\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["On Cloud Economics, Pricing and Revenue Management"], "lenArticle": 505},

The data often has to be processed in real time with limited \r\nmemory space. On the other hand, it has been observed that in most cases, \r\nthe value density of these data is rather low, and they can usually be \r\ncompacted in a small summary that can be used to serve queries on the \r\noriginal data without losing much accuracy. Therefore, building various \r\nsmall summaries over streaming data has received much attention in both \r\nthe algorithms and database communities in recent years.\r\n\r\nThis thesis proposal makes three contributions to this area. First, we \r\ncontinue the study of building quantile summaries over streaming data. \r\nThis is a fundamental problem that has been studied for over 30 years, yet \r\nthere has been limited formal comparison of the competing methods, and no \r\ncomprehensive study of their performance. In this proposal, we remedy this \r\ndeficit by providing a taxonomy of different methods, and describe \r\nefficient implementations. In doing so, we also propose and analyze \r\nvariations that have not been explicitly studied before, yet which turn \r\nout to perform the best.\r\n\r\nSecond, we revisit another classical problem, which is to build a \r\npiecewise linear application (PLA) over streaming time series data. Prior \r\nwork addressed two versions of the problem, where either the PLA consists \r\nof disjoint segments, or it is required to be a continuous piecewise \r\nlinear function. However, we observe that neither minimizes the true \r\nrepresentation size of the PLA, i.e., the number of parameters required to \r\nrepresent it. In this proposal, we design an algorithm that generates the \r\noptimal PLA in terms of representation size while meeting the prescribed \r\nmax-error guarantee.\r\n\r\nThirdly, we propose a new type of summaries, called persistent data \r\nsketching. All existing data summaries are updated upon the arrival of \r\nevery element in the stream, thus destroying its previous version. A \r\npersistent sketch, on the other hand, preserves all its previous versions \r\nas it is updated over time.

To make context sensitive points-to analysis practical to \r\nanalyze contemporary software, which is commonly going up to millions \r\nlines of code, this dissertation explores the use of encoding techniques \r\nto speedup the computation and querying of points-to information. The \r\nfirst part of this dissertation introduces a novel technique, geometric \r\nencoding, to effectively capture the redundancy in representing a large \r\nnumber of calling contexts. Geometric encoding is capable of evaluating \r\ncontexts of points-to constraints in the compressed form, but incurring \r\nmuch less space and time consumption compared to other compressing \r\ntechniques such as BDD. Based on geometric encoding, an efficient context \r\nsensitive points-to engine GeomPTA is designed and implemented. GeomPTA \r\ncan analyze large Java programs with JDK 1.6 library 7.1x \u2013 81.9x faster \r\nthan the worklist based 1-object-sensitive analysis in Paddle, and \r\nmeanwhile its precision is comparable or better than 1-object-sensitive \r\nanalysis. Our implementation of GeomPTA is now part of the official \r\ndistribution of Soot, which is a widely used framework for analyzing Java \r\nprograms.\r\n\r\nSince GeomPTA is fully context sensitive, GeomPTA can answer k-CFA \r\npoints-to queries for any constant k. This dissertation also describes a \r\nnovel contexts-go-by query, where the specified call edge is not \r\nrestricted to the last k call edges ascending from the enclosing function \r\nof the querying pointer. This new query can effectively identify 92.4% \r\nredundant instrumentations for a call trace profiling tool and reduce its \r\nruntime overhead by 7.2%. Both the k-CFA and contexts-go-by queries can be \r\nefficiently answered with the help of geometric encoding.\r\n\r\nAlthough GeomPTA is much faster than other points-to algorithms, analyzing \r\nlarge programs still needs tens of minutes and sometimes the memory usage \r\nexceeds the capacity of a commodity machine. Moreover, some queries, \r\nespecially those require aliasing information, cannot be answered \r\nefficiently merely with the points-to information. Therefore, the second \r\npart of this dissertation describes Pestrie, a persistent technique for \r\ncompressing and reusing points-to and aliasing information. Also, the \r\npersistent information is structured for efficiently answering queries. \r\nEmpirically, Pestrie produces 10.5x \u2013 17.5x smaller persistent files and \r\nis 2.9x \u2013 123.6x faster than points-to results intersection based approach \r\nto answer aliasing queries.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 4 January 2016\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00p.m. - 4:00p.m.\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3584\r\n \t\t\tLifts 27/28\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Matthew McKay (ECE)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Charles Zhang (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung\r\n \t\t\tProf. Fangzhen Lin\r\n \t\t\tProf. Jiang Xu (ECE)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Thomas Reps (Comp.

The \r\nmain challenges have been the frame and the ramification problems. To solve \r\nthem, there has been much work on causal action theories and many different \r\naction languages have been proposed. These approaches and semantics basically \r\nagree when the causal action theories are stratified. However when there is \r\nsome dependency cycle, it is not always clear that what correct and reasonable \r\nresults should be.\r\n\r\nWe propose a new computer-aided approach to characterize action languages in \r\nform of postulates. We first consider a language for writing causal action \r\ntheories, and postulate several properties for the state transition models of \r\nthese theories. Then consider their implementations in logic programs with \r\nanswer set semantics. In particular, we propose to consider what we call \r\npermissible translations from these causal action theories to logic programs. \r\nWith a systematic experiment on a small domain of action theories, we identify \r\na minimal set of postulates, under which there is only one unique permissible \r\ntranslation under strong equivalence. Last, we prove that for arbitrary causal \r\naction theory in the language, the set of postulates gives the same unique \r\ntranslation. Thus an action language is evaluated by postulates over all \r\npossible causal action theories, instead of some examples.\r\n\r\nThis approach is quite general and can be used to evaluate and to compare \r\naction languages in an intuitive sense. And we use this approach to give \r\ncharacterizations of three representative action languages, B, C and BC, and to \r\ncompare them in a brand new perspective. For instance, they solve the \r\nramification problem in different levels. We characterize these action \r\nlanguages in form of postulates, and all possible action theories in the \r\nlanguage are included in the conclusion, with our experiment and proof.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 22 January 2016\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3584\r\n \t\t\tLifts 27/28\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Michael Loy (PHYS)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Fangzhen Lin (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Raymond Wong\r\n \t\t\tProf. Nevin Zhang\r\n \t\t\tProf. Xiangtong Qi (IELM)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Michael Gelfond (Comp.

Exact query processing on \r\nuncertain graphs is prohibitive for most applications, as it involves \r\nevaluation over an exponential number of instantiations. Thus, typical \r\napproaches employ Monte-Carlo sampling, which i) draws a number of possible \r\ngraphs (samples), ii) evaluates the query on each of them, and iii) aggregates \r\nthe individual answers to generate the final result. However, this approach can \r\nalso be extremely time consuming for large uncertain graphs commonly found in \r\npractice. To facilitate efficiency, we study the problem of extracting a single \r\nrepresentative instance from an uncertain graph. Conventional processing \r\ntechniques can then be applied on this representative to closely approximate \r\nthe result on the original graph.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain data utility, the representative instance should preserve \r\nstructural characteristics of the uncertain graph. We start with \r\nrepresentatives that capture the expected vertex degrees, as this is a \r\nfundamental property of the graph topology. We then generalize the notion of \r\nvertex degree to the concept of n-clique cardinality, i.e., the number of \r\ncliques of size n that contain a vertex. For the first problem, we propose two \r\nmethods: Average Degree Rewiring (ADR), which is based on random edge rewiring, \r\nand Approximate B-matching (ABM), which applies graph matching techniques. For \r\nthe second problem, we develop a greedy approach and a game theoretic \r\nframework. We experimentally demonstrate, with real uncertain graphs, that \r\nindeed the representative instances can be used to answer, efficiently and \r\naccurately, queries based on several metrics such as shortest path distance, \r\nclustering coefficient and betweenness centrality.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 27 January 2016\r\n\r\nTime:                  \t2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3584\r\n                         Lifts 27/28\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dimitris Papadias (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Dik-Lun Lee (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Pedro Sander\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Query Processing in Uncertain Graphs"], "lenArticle": 318},

In particular, with \r\nthe development of deep neural network, many new models have been invented \r\nfor topic modeling and language modeling. The advantage of the neural \r\nnetwork models is that it can learn abstract representation of input \r\nfeatures in the intermediate layer. It can represent relationship of \r\nvarious inputs in continuous space. These abstract patterns in the hidden \r\nlayer not only contain the higher level linguistic information, but also \r\nreduce the dimensionality of the input features. The relationship \r\ninformation in the representation can also help reduce data sparsity. Thus \r\nmultiple studies in natural language processing find the neural network \r\nmodel family achieves better performance comparing to traditional models \r\nwith one-hot binary input.\r\n\r\nTopic modeling and language modeling have close relationship both in \r\ntheory and in practice. Generative topic models such as the latent \r\nDirichlet allocation (LDA) describe the document-topic-word arrangement \r\nusing latent variables. They can be seen as bag-of-words language models \r\nwhich neglect the word order. However, it is very likely that the word \r\norder information can be useful to topic modeling or text categorization \r\ntasks. It may represent the pattern of phrases or certain combination of \r\nthe words, which appears regularly in particular topic settings. On the \r\nother hand, topic information can also contribute to language modeling. \r\nThe simplest case is to add a topic vector as an extra feature to a neural \r\nnetwork language model, so as to adapt the language model towards specific \r\ntopics.\r\n\r\nThis article provides a survey over important methods of topic modeling \r\nand language modeling, putting emphasis on models related to neural \r\nnetworks.

They fail to arouse users\u2019 \r\ninterest in the recommendations because the recommendations soon become \r\nvery familiar to the users. Discovery-oriented recommendation systems \r\n(DORSs) complement accuracy with discover utilities (DUs) such as novelty \r\nand diversity to entice users to explore beyond their interests by \r\noptimizing the DUs and the accuracy of the recommendations. Unfortunately, \r\nDORSs ignore an important fact that different users have different \r\nappetite for DUs. That is, highly curious users can accept highly novel \r\nand diversified recommendations whereas conservative users would behave in \r\nthe opposite manner.\r\n\r\nWe propose a curiosity-based recommendation system (CBRS) framework which \r\ngenerates recommendations with a personalized amount of DUs to fit the \r\nuser\u2019s curiosity level. We propose a computational model of user \r\ncuriosity, called Probabilistic Curiosity Model (PCM), which is based on \r\nthe curiosity arousal theory and Wundt curve in psychology research. In \r\nPCM, we model a user\u2019s curiosity with a curiosity distribution function \r\nlearnt from the user\u2019s access history and compute a curiousness score for \r\neach item representing how curious the user is about the item. CBRS then \r\nselects items which are both relevant and have high curiousness score, \r\nbounded by the constraint that the amount of DUs fits the user\u2019s DU \r\nappetite. We use joint optimization and co-factorization approaches to \r\nincorporate the curiosity signal into RSs.

Among \r\nall the signals proposed for indoor positioning, Wi-Fi emerges as a \r\npromising and cost-effective one due to the pervasive deployment of \r\nwireless LANs (WLANs). Wi-Fi fingerprinting has attracted much attention \r\nrecently because it does not require line-of-sight measurement from access \r\npoints (APs), and has high applicability in complex indoor environment.\r\n\r\nOffering quality ILBS requires accurate indoor positioning.  In this \r\nthesis, we study several approaches to make Wi-Fi fingerprinting highly \r\naccurate.  The approaches are to mitigate noisy signal measurement, to \r\nfuse distance sensor with fingerprinting, and to adaptively learn \r\nfingerprint patterns over time.  We will conduct extensive experimental \r\nstudies to validate the performance of the approaches.\r\n\r\nPrevious fingerprinting positioning based on certain similarity metric \r\noften suffers from ambiguous matching problem of reference points, \r\nresulting in high decision uncertainty. To address this, we propose a \r\nnovel approach based on junction of signal tiles, which are formed based \r\non the first two moments of the signals. The target location is then \r\nconstrained within the junction area. This overcomes position ambiguity \r\nproblem and achieves highly accurate positioning.\r\n\r\nTo further enhance localization accuracy, we study how to fuse fingerprint \r\nwith distance information. Our approach is applicable to a wide range of \r\nsensors (peer-assisted, inertial navigation sensor, etc.) and wireless \r\nfingerprints (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.). By a novel optimization formulation \r\nwhich jointly fuses distance bounds and measured fingerprint signals, it \r\nachieves low positioning errors even under complex indoor environment.\r\n\r\nFingerprinting accuracy deteriorates if the AP signals are altered (due to \r\nAP movement, partitioning, etc.).  We propose and study a novel \r\nclustering-based scheme which can localize targets despite AP alteration, \r\nand can identify the altered APs. Using a novel Gaussian process, our \r\nalgorithm can also adapt the fingerprint map to the altered signal \r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 26 February 2016\r\n\r\nTime:                  \t10:00am - 12:00noon\r\n\r\nVenue:                  CYTG001\r\n                         CYT Building\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Gary Chan (Supervisor)\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Pan Hui (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Enhancing Accuracy for Fingerprint-based Indoor Localization"], "lenArticle": 354},

Naturally, this \r\nhas been accompanied by a constant expansion of data centers in scale and in \r\ngeographical outreach worldwide, resulting in a dramatic growth of the energy \r\nconsumed to power such data centers. Several studies indicate that the energy \r\nconsumed today by data centers is equivalent to the annual output of 34 large \r\n(500-megawatt) coal-red power plants in the US alone. This number is forecast \r\nto reach double in less than 10 years. The huge amount of energy consumption \r\nnot only costs data center providers billions of dollars, but also generate \r\nhundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon pollution per year. Energy consumption \r\nin data centers comes from several aspects: i) computing and networking \r\nequipments, ii) cooling equipments, and iii) power draw and other ancillary \r\nequipments. Any reduction of such consumption is seen as such a boon that some \r\ndata center providers such as Facebook and Google have built data centers in as \r\nfar ung area as the Arctic circle, while others like Microsoft are considering \r\nundersea data centers, to cut cooling costs. In this thesis, we consider \r\nseveral important problems of resource allocation in data center while \r\noptimizing the energy consumed by computing and networking equipments.\r\n\r\nThe thesis is structured in three parts. The rst part falls within the area of \r\nthe so-called platform-as-a-service (PaaS) cloud service model and deals with \r\njob scheduling in the MapReduce massive-data parallel-processing framework. In \r\nthis part we consider energy efficiency as a byproduct of minimizing the jobs . \r\nMore specically, we first propose a new scheduling algorithm called Multiple \r\nQueue Scheduler (MQS) to improve the data locality rate of tasks as a means to \r\ncurbing the costly data migration delays. Then, to take into account the \r\nintricate details of MapReduce framework such as the early shuffle problem, we \r\npropose the Dynamic Priority Multiple Queue Scheduler (DPMQS) to further \r\nimprove MQS. DPMQS dynamically increases the priority of jobs that are close to \r\ncompleting their Map phase to speed up the start of the reduce phase, thus \r\nreducing further the expected job holding time and thus the makespan. We \r\nimplemented both algorithms in Hadoop and compared their performance to other \r\nexisting algorithms. The second part falls within the realm of \r\ninfrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and deals with energy efficient virtual \r\nmachine (VM) scheduling in data centers. In this part we formulate the minimum \r\nenergy VM scheduling as a non-convex optimization model, prove its NP-hardness, \r\nthen explore two greedy approximation algorithms, minimum energy VM scheduling \r\nalgorithm (MinES) and minimum communication VM scheduling algorithm (MinCS), to \r\nreduce the energy while satisfying the data center tenants service level \r\nagreements. Current IaaS service providers only support rudimentary network \r\ntopologies that simply consist of a super-sized virtual switch interconnecting \r\na tenant's VMs. To increase the business potential of such platforms by \r\nsupporting more intricate network topologies as specied by the tenants, we \r\nconsider in the third part of this thesis the problem of embedding virtual \r\nclusters into a data center in a energy efficient manner. We carefully provide \r\na mathematical optimization model of this problem, then given its NP-hardness, \r\nwe propose an approximate algorithm minimum energy virtual cluster embedding \r\n(MinE-VCE) to solve the problem.

The large scale image \r\ndata sets are unordered, redundant and spotty, which introduce more challenges \r\nin the aspect of efficiency and accuracy. The state-of-the-art of 3D \r\nreconstruction consists of two key ingredients, Structure-from-Motion(SfM) and \r\nMultiple View Stereo(MVS). Structure-from-Motion is to extract camera poses and \r\nfeature point positions from images and Multiple View Stereo is to reconstruct \r\na complete 3D representation of an object or scene. In the large scale SfM , it \r\nmust be solved how to matching large scale images and validate camera poses. In \r\nthe large scale MVS, the large scale challenges concentrate on the selection of \r\nsuitable images and dividing-and-conquer problem.\r\n\r\nIn this survey, we first introduce the state-of-the-art of 3D reconstruction \r\nand the problem definitions in each stage. Then, we will focus on the two core \r\nstages of 3D reconstruction, Structure-from-Motion and Multiple View Stereo. In \r\nthe reviewing of the two stages, the fundamental will be first reviewed as they \r\nare essential to tackle the large scale problem. Then, we will review the \r\nsignificant methods and systems to solve the large scale problems.

We believe that it should be possible to improve both translation \r\nadequacy and fluency by replacing the conventional alignment algorithms with \r\nmore semantically motivated alignments. Our approach is further motivated by \r\nthe fact that including semantic role labeling in the SMT pipeline in a \r\ndifferent way has already been shown to significantly improve the quality of \r\nthe machine translation output.\r\n\r\nRecent research defines a good translation as one where a human can \r\nsuccessfully understand the core semantics as captured by the basic event \r\nstructure: \u201cwho did what to whom, for whom, when, where, how and why\u201d. The \r\nMEANT family of metrics are semantic evaluation metrics that correlate \r\nbetter with human adequacy judgment compared to most commonly used surface \r\nbased metrics. MEANT produces a score measuring the degree of similarity \r\nbetween the semantic frame structures of the MT output against semantic \r\nframe structures of provided reference translations. Our analysis is \r\nencouraged by the fact that many previous studies have empirically shown \r\nthat integrating semantic role labeling into the training pipeline by \r\ntuning against MEANT improves the translation adequacy.\r\n\r\nThe quality of machine translation output relies heavily on word \r\nalignment. However, the most widespread approach to word alignment is \r\nstill an outdated method of training IBM models in both directions and \r\ncombining their results using various heuristics. Word alignments based on \r\ninversion transduction grammars or ITGs, on the other hand, have been \r\nshown to provide a more structured model leading to efficient and accurate \r\nbidirectional alignments. In this survey we discuss how conventional \r\nalignment algorithms fail to learn a meaningful mapping between the input \r\nand target language.

Key agreement protocol was rst \r\npresented in 1976 by W. Di e and M. Hellman [1] and has become the most \r\nwell-known tech- nique used. A password-based authenticated key exchange (PAKE) \r\nis a type of key agreement which enables two parties to mutual authenticate \r\nbasing solely on human memorable passwords.\r\n\r\nNormally cryptographic keys were the only way to ensure the authentication \r\npart, those long-term keys require adding a cryptographic device to store them, \r\ntherefore substitute keys with password seems to be much more convenient. \r\nBesides, such protocol is able to avoid using the public key infrastructure \r\n(PKI), accordingly, PAKE gained a lot of importance during the past few years, \r\nnevertheless, the design of a PAKE protocol is harder due to the low entropy \r\npasswords. At the beginning of this thesis we start by introducing some \r\nmathematical tools which are compulsory to the design and understanding \r\nprotocols.

Unlike sequential programs, concurrent programs may \r\nbehave differently even given the same input, making concurrency bugs much \r\nharder to be reproduced than bugs caused within a single thread. This thesis \r\ntargets on the reproduction of shared-memory concurrency bugs, together with \r\nnew techniques for the bug diagnostics given the capability of reproducing the \r\nbug.\r\n\r\nFirst, we contribute Stride, a deterministic replay technique for concurrent \r\nprograms, that improves the efficiency of the recording phase, which is key to \r\nthe practicability of replay techniques. Stride records the bounded read-write \r\nlinkage instead of the exact linkage, which eliminates synchronization \r\nrequirements on read operations during the recording phase and is still able to \r\nsynthesize a legal execution in polynomial time. Comparing to the previous \r\nstate-of-the-art approaches of deterministic replay, Stride is on average 2.5 \r\ntimes faster.\r\n\r\nSecond, we handle concurrency bug reproduction under two special scenarios with \r\nspecial requirements. One is the bug reproduction for relaxed memory model(RMM) \r\nspecific behaviors, the challenge of which is the Heisenberg effects caused by \r\nthe code instrumentation incurred by bug reproduction techniques (Some RMM \r\nspecific behaviors cannot occur in the instrumented program), which leads to a \r\npoor coverage. We contribute SC-Transformation, the first technique that \r\nenables safe instrumentation under RMMs with the provable guarantee of full \r\ncoverage, i.e., instrumentations on the program do not prevent RMM-specific \r\nbehaviors. Therefore, we can apply all kinds of instrumentations to \r\ndeterministically reproduce RMM-specific behaviors. Experiments show that, \r\nsupported by SC-Transformation, we successfully recorded all of the seventy-one \r\nRMM-specific bug traces we tested, none of which could be captured atop naive \r\nprogram instrumentation. The second special scenario is the bug reproduction on \r\nthe production runs on I/O intensive programs, the challenge of which is the \r\nlong running time and the large input size. We contribute POINT, which departs \r\nfrom the conventional philosophy of reproducing a similar execution by going a \r\nnew direction of reproducing only the interleaving windows occurring among a \r\nfew lines of code. Being more focused on the source of concurrency bugs, POINT \r\nrequires no duplication of the user inputs and supports programs running for \r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have developed a method that deterministically pinpoints the root \r\ncause of concurrency bugs given the capability of reproducing the bug, which is \r\nachieved by deterministically isolating the effects of the context-switches \r\nwithin the buggy execution.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 17 March 2016\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 4504\r\n  \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. Zongjin Li (CIVL)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Charles Zhang (Supervisor)\r\n  \t\t\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung\r\n  \t\t\tProf. Fangzhen Lin\r\n  \t\t\tProf. Maosheng Xiong (MATH)\r\n  \t\t\tProf. Grigore Rosu (U of Illinois At\r\n \t\t\t\t\t    Urbana-Champaign)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["REPRODUCING SHARED-MEMORY CONCURRENCY BUGS FOR BUG DIAGNOSTICS"], "lenArticle": 486},

In this thesis proposal, we \r\nstudy how to achieve efficient live streaming among cooperative wireless \r\ndevices. In such a mobile peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming network, mobile \r\nstations (MSs) relay their received packets in a multi-hop manner by means \r\nof broadcasting using a secondary channel (such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth). \r\nSuch network greatly increases network scalability by multiplying its \r\navailable bandwidth, extends its coverage and improves its recovery \r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nThe design of the broadcast overlay is crucial to streaming efficiency in \r\nterms of achievable streaming rate. We hence propose a novel overlay \r\ncalled LocalTree which seeks to minimize the total network traffic while \r\ncovering all the clients. LocalTree takes advantage of stable clusters of \r\nMSs to construct streaming overlay. It combines the strengths of both \r\nstructured and unstructured overlay designs, and is simple and effective.\r\n\r\nWe next investigate live free viewpoint video (FVV) streaming in a \r\nwireless cooperative multihop network. An FVV is composed of a large \r\nnumber of camera-captured anchor views, with virtual views (not captured \r\nby any camera) rendered from their nearby anchors using techniques such as \r\ndepth-image-based rendering (DIBR). Given limited wireless bandwidth at \r\nthe MSs, we seek to maximize the received video quality (i.e., minimize \r\ndistortion). We propose a distributed algorithm called PAFV (Peer-Assisted \r\nFreeview Video), which achieves scalability and high video quality.\r\n\r\nPacket loss is inevitable in wireless video streaming due to dynamic \r\nchannel condition. To address this, we finally study P2P cooperative error \r\nrecovery for video broadcasting. In our system, an MS may generate some \r\nparity packets and share them to its neighbors. An important problem is to \r\nminimize the total number of parity packets generated while achieving a \r\ncertain residual loss rate. We propose BOPPER (Broadcast-based P2P Error \r\nRecovery), a novel and fully distributed algorithm to achieve low residual \r\nloss.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 18 March 2016\r\n\r\nTime:                  \t10:30am - 12:30pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3588\r\n                         (lifts 27/28)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Gary Chan (Supervisor)\r\n  \t\t\tProf. Cunsheng Ding (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Wei Wang\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Efficient Live Video Streaming for Wireless Multihop Networks"], "lenArticle": 365},

The major \r\nconcerns are performance issue for large networks and how to facilitate network \r\nmanagement by SDN visibility.\r\n\r\nInitially, we explore the extra flow setup latency by the controller and switch \r\ncommunication. To eliminate the overhead, we propose a system which predicts \r\nfrequent communication pair and proactively installs forwarding wildcard rules.\r\n\r\nThen, we concentrate on software defined measurement and propose three novel \r\nschemes to optimize network monitoring efficiency in a top-down approach. \r\nFirst, we present a cross-layer optimization for sketch-based measurement.

{"date": "2016-03-22", "description": "\nMPhil Thesis Defence\r\n\r\n\r\nTitle: \"SOCIAL RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS WITH ITEM-BASED REGULARIZATION\"\r\n\r\nBy\r\n\r\nMr. Hao GE\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nGiven the increasingly large amount of information on the Internet, \r\nrecommendation systems have been widely used to recommend interesting \r\ninformation to the users so that they do not have to proactively look for \r\nit by using search engines or visiting websites. Recommendation systems \r\ncan help users filter out irrelevant information, thus reducing the \r\ninformation overloading problem. Further, by monitoring users actions on \r\nthe recommendations, information producers can gain a better understanding \r\nof the users\u2019 interest and hence can focus their resources on delivering \r\ninformation that would arouse the users interest.\r\n\r\nIn parallel with the advent of recommendation systems, online social media \r\nhas gained dramatic increase in usage across different communities. The \r\nsocial relations created in social networks are of great value in \r\nimproving the performance of traditional recommendation systems because \r\npeople who are socially related have strong influence on each other in \r\ntheir interests, tastes and opinions, etc. The synergy between \r\nrecommendation systems and social networks has received much attention \r\nfrom researchers in both industry and academia.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we develop a new technique to integrate social information \r\ninto recommendation systems to improve recommendation quality. We choose \r\nmatrix factorization model as the basic recommendation framework upon \r\nwhich we add social information. In matrix factorization model, both users \r\nand items are mapped into a joint latent factor space and the user-item \r\nratings are inner products of vectors in that space. To take advantage of \r\nsocial information, we introduce regularization terms to influence the \r\nresult of matrix factorization. Previous methods typically use user-based \r\nregularization term to make recommendations of socially connect users as \r\nclose to each other as possible. Unfortunately, it is hard to identify \r\nusers with similar interests because a user may have multiple interests \r\nand having some identical interests does not mean that the users have \r\nidentical interests overall. Instead of using user-based regularization \r\nterm, our proposed method introduces item-based regularization term. The \r\nadvantage of our approach is that comparing to the diversity of user \r\ninterest, an item typically has specific purposes, properties or \r\napplications, making it easier to identify similar items from the users \r\nwho are interested in them. For example, a user is interested in a book on \r\nData Mining and another user is interested in a book on Machine Learning, \r\nwe can infer that they have some similar interests but cannot conclude \r\nthat they have identical interests because they may have different \r\ninterests in other domain (e.g., movie). On the other hand, there should \r\nbe much overlap between users who are interested in a book on Data Mining \r\nand users who are interested in a book on Machine Leaning. Thus, the two \r\nbooks should be similar and share close latent vectors. We conduct \r\nexperiments using a dataset from Douban, and Mean Average Error and Root \r\nMean Square Error are used as performance metrics. We demonstrate that our \r\nmethod can improve the performance in the recommendation tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 15 April 2016\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:30am - 12:30pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 2130B\r\n \t\t\tLift 19\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dik-Lun Lee (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Wilfred Ng\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["SOCIAL RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS WITH ITEM-BASED REGULARIZATION"], "lenArticle": 527},

With the reconstructed 3D geometry, the training data are \r\ninitialized resorting to urban priors. We segment the input images and 3D data \r\ninto semantic categories simultaneously by employing a novel joint object \r\ncorrespondence graph which purifies the automatically generated training \r\nsamples.\r\n\r\nOur second task is to recognize and segment individual building objects. We \r\nextract building objects from the orthographic view and then fuse the \r\ndecomposed roof segmentation to 3D models through a structure-aware flooding \r\nalgorithm. Each building footprint is abstracted by a set of structural \r\nprimitives that are best fit to the model geometry and also conform to the \r\ndiscovered global regularities. We extend our patchwork assembly to recognize \r\nmore detailed but structural objects in architectures, such as windows, and \r\nthen reassemble them based on the recognized grammars. The facade structure is \r\nrecognized at the object level with a structure-driven Monte Carlo Markov Chain \r\nsampler. The solution space is explored with high efficiency because the \r\nstructure-driven sampler accelerates convergence by utilizing the \r\nrepetitiveness priors.\r\n\r\nSemantic information is able to improve the robustness and accuracy of the \r\ninitially reconstructed models. It can enhance building model regularities and \r\nprovide plausible tree model completion using rules. The building \r\nregularization is achieved by leveraging a set of structural linear features. \r\nWe propose reliable linear features from images, triangulate them in space, and \r\ninfer their spatial relations with a non-linear programing method. The poses of \r\nthe linear features are adjusted to satisfy the inferred relations in a \r\nleast-square manner, followed by a smooth deformation of the entire mesh \r\ngeometry. Furthermore, we propose an approach for automatically generating 3D \r\nmodels of natural-looking and photorealistic palm trees, which is seldom \r\ninvestigated. Given a palm tree image and its segmentation, we extract the 2D \r\ntree structure using an edge tracing method and construct the 3D structure by \r\nestimating depths through a fast force-based approach. Textures are obtained by \r\nminimizing the photometric projection error.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we transfer the 3D reconstruction from a pure geometry-based \r\nrepresentation to a semantic representation at the object level on which \r\nhigh-level applications can be built, and remodel the object with specific \r\nsemantic meanings to be visually pleasing and computationally compact. We \r\ndemonstrate our methods on a few large and challenging datasets.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 21 April 2016\r\n\r\nTime:                  \t3:00pm - 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 5510\r\n                         (lifts 25/26)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Long Quan (Supervisor)\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Pedro Sander (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Albert Chung\r\n  \t\t\tProf. James Kwok\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Urban Scene Segmentation, Recognition and Remodeling"], "lenArticle": 491},

Mobile \r\ncrowdsourcing has inspired many applications and systems, bringing great \r\nconvenience to research, production and people\u2019s daily life. Yet to \r\nfurther enjoy the benefit of MCS, we still face many challenges ranging \r\nfrom mechanism design to system implementation. In this thesis, we address \r\nthree challenging topics in mobile crowdsourcing. They are task management \r\nfor quality control, incentive mechanism design and mobile apps \r\ndevelopment during MCS system implementation. For each topic, we focus on \r\ncertain scenarios and specific problems.\r\n\r\nFirst, we considers the quality-aware online assignment problem for \r\nlocation-based tasks, which are typical in mobile crowdsourcing. A \r\nprobabilistic quality measurement model is proposed and a hitchhiking \r\nmodel is introduced to characterize workers\u2019 behavior. After \r\nmathematically formulating the online assignment problem, a \r\npolynomial-time online assignment algorithm is designed to optimize tasks\u2019 \r\noverall quality. The proposed algorithm is proven to approximates the \r\noffline optimal solution with a competitive ratio of 10 7 . Its efficiency \r\nand effectiveness is further demonstrated through extensive simulations.\r\n\r\nCrowdsouced mobile network access (CMNA), or user-provided connectivity, \r\nprovides more flexible and ubiquitous Internet access among mobile users. \r\nIn the second work, we study the incentive mechanism for an \r\noperator-assisted CMNA model. In this model, subscribers are incentivized \r\nby a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) to operate as mobile WiFi hot \r\nspots. Subscribers earns reimbursement from MVNO and MVNO gets revenue \r\nfrom the relayed traffic. Their equilibrium strategies are characterized \r\non the basis of probabilistic analysis as a two-stage Bayesian game. A \r\npartial cooperation strategy (PCS) is designed for MVNO and subscribers to \r\noptimize their benefit, which is more practical (compared with symmetric \r\nstrategy) and incurs much less overhead.\r\n\r\nAs most MCS systems rely on mobile apps on smartphones as terminals, \r\nmobile apps development is a critical part in MCS systems implementation. \r\nLastly we target at the resource management problem during mobile apps \r\ndevelopment. If the various resources are misused, severe problems may \r\noccur. We mine resource management specifications in a crowdsourced way \r\nand a tool called Automatic Resource Specification Miner (ARSM) is \r\ndeveloped. ARSM collects the usage of resources related APIs from \r\noff-the-shelf apps, which come from the developer crowd. Then it mines \r\nfrequent patterns from the gathered resource usage information. With the \r\nhelp of ARSM, resource management specifications could guide software \r\nengineers while developing apps and pinpointing bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 26 April 2016\r\n\r\nTime:                  \t4:00pm - 6:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3588\r\n                         (lifts 27/28)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Lei Chen (Supervisor)\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Cunsheng Ding\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Towards Practical Mobile Crowdsourcing: From Mechanism Design to Software Implementation"], "lenArticle": 465},

Despite this popularity, the \r\ndeployment of HeNBs has also introduced a new set of resource inefficiency \r\nproblems, caused mainly by inter-cell interference and indoor traffic load \r\nfluctuation. A large body of previous work has been devoted to improving the \r\nutilization of network resources in HeNBs, including, frequency planning, time \r\ndivision, power control, and space division. Nevertheless, many problems not \r\naddressed adequately by these studies remain open, especially those related to \r\ncommunication overhead, computational complexity, and service quality.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of standardized resource allocation mechanisms for LTE HeNBs, in \r\nthis work we focus on designing effective solutions to the resource allocation \r\nproblem in HeNB networks; and address three operational environments: i) \r\nopen-access enterprise networks, ii) closed-access residential networks, and \r\niii) open-access residential networks.\r\n\r\nFirst, we focus on improving the resource utilization in centrally-controlled \r\nopen-access enterprise networks such as enterprise HeNB networks and Wireless \r\nLocal Area Networks (WLAN). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first \r\nto study jointly optimizing user association, beam selection, link scheduling, \r\nand power adaptation in such networks. We proposed a unified conflict-free \r\nscheduling algorithm, that can be directly implemented in HeNB networks, and \r\nalso designed the TD-CSMA protocol to enable deployment in WLANs.\r\n\r\nNext, identifying the difficulty of implementing X-2 interfaces among HeNBs, we \r\npropose fully distributed resource allocation solutions for non-cooperative \r\ndistributed closed-access residential networks. We introduced a self-learning \r\nHeNB MAC protocol to mitigate interference based on exploitation of historical \r\nuser feedback. The learning process is modelled as a cluster-structural \r\nregret-based learning game, where the users within one HeNB form a cluster to \r\nshare information.\r\n\r\nFinally, we examined the problem of the energy cost of running a massive number \r\nof always-on HeNBs worldwide and focused on designing an energy efficient, \r\nQoS-constrained MAC protocol for cooperative distributed open-access \r\nresidential HeNB networks. Since most previous work has failed to properly \r\nconsider interference mitigation when designing such protocols, we manipulate \r\nuser association and OFDMA scheduling with a combination of interference \r\nmitigation. We proposed two iterative algorithms guaranteed to converge based \r\non inter-HeNB communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 27 April 2016\r\n\r\nTime:                  \t3:00pm - 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 5560\r\n                         (lifts 27/28)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Brahim Bensaou (Supervisor)\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Gary Chan\r\n  \t\t\tProf. Danny Tsang (ECE)\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Effective Resource Allocation in Home Evolved Node Base Station Networks"], "lenArticle": 421},

A variety of data \r\ntracking human mobility, namely human mobility data, has been generated \r\nand collected within urban context, providing unprecedented opportunities \r\nto understand regional dynamics in urban area, which is of great social \r\nand business value in a variety of applications. However, due to large \r\nvolumes and dynamic correlations of these data as well as high complexity \r\nof analytical tasks in real world applications, it is challenging for \r\nanalysts to carry out in-depth analysis and extract valuable information. \r\nIt often requires integrating human perception in the data exploration \r\nprocess, triggering a broad use of visual analytics. With visual \r\nanalytics, we can include human perception in the data exploration process \r\nefficiently and combine the flexibility, creativity and domain knowledge \r\nof human beings with enormous storage capacity and computational power of \r\ntoday's computers.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we introduce three advanced visual analysis techniques for \r\nuncovering regional dynamics in urban area from different aspects based on \r\nheterogeneous human mobility data. In particular, we first study the \r\nsubject matter of regional boundary change and present BoundarySeer. It is \r\na visual analytics system consisting of four major viewers to facilitate \r\nthe general analytical tasks dealing with boundary changes of a region in \r\nurban area. Secondly, a visual analytics system, TelCoVis, is presented to \r\nfacilitate the exploration of co-occurrence in human mobility (i.e. people \r\nfrom two regions visit an urban place during the same time span) and \r\nhidden correlations based on telco data.

However, analyzing and exploring movement is not an easy \r\ntask due to its intrinsic multivariate natures, hidden correlations among \r\nproperties and complex analytical tasks in real world applications. Therefore, \r\nanalysts seek the help of visualization to integrate humans in the data \r\nexploration process, applying their perceptual abilities to target datasets and \r\nleveraging their domain knowledge to guide the exploration for effective \r\nunderstanding, reasoning and decision making. Movement visualization has been \r\nwidely studied in recent years concerning about novel and effective visual \r\ndesigns and user interactions for analysts to gain insight into real world \r\ndatasets. In this thesis, we follow this line of research and propose three \r\nvisualization techniques or visual analysis approaches to facilitate in-depth \r\nanalyses of bi-directional and cluster movements.\r\n\r\nIn the first work, we propose a visual analytics system to investigate \r\nbi-directional movement behaviors. More specifically, we first design a \r\nmovement model with modular DoI specification characterizing bi-directional \r\nmovement. Then several novel visualization designs, including OD-pair Flow View \r\nand Isotime Storyline View are proposed with intuitive user interactions to \r\nallow users to interactively explore and analyze both micro and macro patterns \r\nof bi-directional movement behaviors.\r\n\r\nIn the second work, we develop TelcoFlow, a visual analytics system to study \r\ncollective behaviors based on the large scale of telco data. Advanced \r\nquantitative analyses including state-based probabilistic behavior model and \r\nbiclustering are utilized to quantify and detect collective behaviors. \r\nMeanwhile, a set of intuitive visualization techniques with new designs is \r\nintegrated to present the detected patterns for an in-depth analysis.\r\n\r\nIn the third work, we present a novel animation planning technique, namely \r\nFocus+Context Grouping, that can allow users to track movement of focal targets \r\nwhile not neglecting the context (i.e. the overall moving trend). It can be \r\nintegrated with static visualizations to provide a more straightforward \r\npresentation of movement and improve users\u2019 performance on movement analysis. \r\nIn particular, a novel tree cut algorithm is proposed to cluster moving objects \r\nand balance between efficiency and accuracy based on the key factors affecting \r\npeople\u2019s perception of animation.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed techniques in \r\nfacilitating various analytical tasks, we conduct several case studies based on \r\nreal-world datasets, one user study for Focus+Context Grouping technique, and \r\ncollect feedback from domain experts.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 16 May 2016\r\n\r\nTime:                  \t3:00pm - 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 4472\r\n                         (lifts 25/26)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Lionel Ni (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Huamin Qu (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Cunsheng Ding (Chairperson)\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Xiaojuan Ma\r\n  \t\t\tProf. Chiew-Lan Tai\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Visual Analytics of Bi-directional and Cluster Movements"], "lenArticle": 462},

Several \r\nstudies indicate that the energy consumed today by data centers is \r\nequivalent to the annual output of 34 large (500-megawatt) coal-red power \r\nplants in the US alone.This number is forecast to reach double in less \r\nthan 10 years. The huge amount of energy consumption not only costs data \r\ncenter providers billions of dollars, but also generate hundreds of \r\nmillions of tonnes of carbon pollution per year. Energy consumption in \r\ndata centers comes from several aspects: i) computing and networking \r\nequipments, ii) cooling equipments, and iii) power draw and other \r\nancillary equipments. Any reduction of such consumption is seen as such a \r\nboon that some data center providers such as Facebook and Google have \r\nbuilt data centers in as far flung area as the Arctic circle, while others \r\nlike Microsoft are considering undersea data centers, to cut cooling \r\ncosts. In this thesis, we consider several important problems of resource \r\nallocation in data center while optimizing the energy consumed by \r\ncomputing and networking equipments.\r\n\r\nThe thesis is structured in three parts. The first part falls within the \r\narea of the socalled platform-as-a-service (PaaS) cloud service model and \r\ndeals with job scheduling in the MapReduce massive-data \r\nparallel-processing framework. In this part we consider energy efficiency \r\nas a by-product of minimizing the jobs . More specifically, we first \r\npropose a new scheduling algorithm called Multiple Queue Scheduler (MQS) \r\nto improve the data locality rate of tasks as a means to curbing the \r\ncostly data migration delays. Then, to take into account the intricate \r\ndetails of MapReduce framework such as the early shuffle problem, we \r\npropose the Dynamic Priority Multiple Queue Scheduler (DPMQS) to further \r\nimprove MQS. DPMQS dynamically increases the priority of jobs that are \r\nclose to completing their Map phase to speed up the start of the reduce \r\nphase, thus reducing further the expected job holding time and thus the \r\nmakespan. We implemented both algorithms in Hadoop and compared their \r\nperformance to other existing algorithms. The second part falls within the \r\nrealm of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and deals with energy \r\nefficient virtual machine (VM) scheduling in data centers. In this part we \r\nformulate the minimum energy VM scheduling as a non-convex optimization \r\nmodel, prove its NP-hardness, then explore two greedy approximation \r\nalgorithms, minimum energy VM scheduling algorithm (MinES) and minimum \r\ncommunication VM scheduling algorithm (MinCS), to reduce the energy while \r\nsatisfying the data center tenants service level agreements. Current IaaS \r\nservice providers only support rudimentary network topologies that simply \r\nconsist of a super-sized virtual switch interconnecting a tenant's VMs. To \r\nincrease the business potential of such platforms by supporting more \r\nintricate network topologies as specified by the tenants, we consider in \r\nthe third part of this thesis the problem of embedding virtual clusters \r\ninto a data center in a energy efficient manner. We carefully provide a \r\nmathematical optimization model of this problem, then given its \r\nNP-hardness, we propose an approximate algorithm minimum energy virtual \r\ncluster embedding (MinE-VCE) to solve the problem. We tested all proposed \r\nalgorithms using real data traces as well as synthetic ones to demonstrate \r\ntheir performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 2 June 2016\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 5501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nChairman:\t\tProf. J.S.

On EBSN platforms, \r\nevent organizers organize a variety of offline social events and online \r\nusers register for and participate in such offline events. An important \r\ntask of EBSNs is to facilitate a satisfactory event-participant \r\narrangement for both sides, i.e. events enroll suitable participants and \r\nparticipants are arranged with personally interesting events. Existing \r\napproaches usually focus on arranging to a set of potential users one \r\nsingle event and do not consider spatio-temporal information or conflicts \r\namong different events, which can lead to infeasible arrangements. In \r\naddition, no existing work considers online scenarios of event \r\narrangement, where users arrive at the platform one by one and only \r\npartial information is available during the decision making process. In \r\nthis thesis proposal, to address the shortcomings of existing approaches, \r\nwe identify more general and useful event-participant arrangement problems \r\nand propose efficient and effective solutions to address different \r\nscenarios of event-participant arrangement over EBSNs. To summarize, our \r\nstudy addresses the following three problems:\r\n\r\n1. We identify an event-participant arrangement problem, called the Global \r\nEvent-participant Arrangement with Conflict and Capacity (GEACC) problem, \r\nthat focuses on resolving conflicts of different events and making \r\nevent-participant arrangements in a global view. We prove that the GEACC \r\nproblem is NP-hard and design quality-guaranteed approximate algorithms to \r\naddress this problem.\r\n\r\n2. We further address the online scenario of GEACC and design an online \r\nalgorithm with provable performance guarantee.\r\n\r\n3. We study another event-participant arrangement problem that further \r\nconsiders location information of events and users. We present a \r\ngreedy-based heuristic algorithm and a two-step approximation framework \r\nwith guaranteed approximation ratio and a series of optimization \r\ntechniques.\r\n\r\nWe verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solutions with \r\nextensive experiments and discuss interesting future work on \r\nevent-participant arrangement over EBSNs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 2 June 2016\r\n\r\nTime:                  \t3:00pm - 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 5504\r\n                         (lifts 25/26)\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Lei Chen (Supervisor)\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Wei Wang (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["On Event-Participant Arrangement over Event-Based Social Networks"], "lenArticle": 367},

We first introduce a general GSK \r\nframework that covers a wide range of real-world tasks, including \r\nadvertisement, context-based search, and market analysis. Then, we present \r\nthree concrete GSK queries: (i) NPRU that returns the top-k users based on \r\ntheir spatial proximity to a given query location, their popularity, and their \r\nsimilarity to an input set of terms; (ii) NSTP that outputs the top-k POIs \r\nbased on their proximity to a user v, the number of check-ins by friends of v, \r\nand their similarity to a set of terms; (iii) FSKR that discovers the top-k \r\nkeywords based on their frequency in pairs of friends located within a spatial \r\narea. For each query, we develop a processing algorithm that utilizes a novel \r\nhybrid index.\r\n\r\nWe further extend this framework to incorporate diversification in GSK search. \r\nTop-k queries can give results that are very similar to each other, hence \r\ncompromising their effectiveness in various applications. For instance, \r\nreturned users of an NPRU query may have many common friends, in which case \r\nadvertising budget would be wasted in repeatedly promoting to the same set of \r\nusers. In view of this limitation, we investigate diversification and extend \r\nGSK to Diverse Geo-Social Keyword search (DGSK) by introducing a trade-off \r\nbetween query-similarity and result-diversity. We show that this problem is \r\nNP-Complete in our setting. We propose two greedy algorithms and provide \r\ntheoretical analysis of their approximation bounds.

To address this threat, publishers have started \r\nretaliating by employing ad-block detectors, which scout for ad-blocker \r\nusers and react to them by restricting their content access and pushing \r\nthem to whitelist the website or disabling ad-blockers altogether. The \r\nclash between ad-blockers and ad-block detectors has resulted in a new \r\narms race on the web.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we present the first systematic measurement and analysis \r\nof ad-block detection on the web. We have designed and implemented a \r\nmachine learning based technique to automatically detect ad-block \r\ndetection, and use it to study the deployment of ad-block detectors on \r\nAlexa top- 100K websites. The approach is promising with precision of \r\n94.8% and recall of 93.1%. We characterize the spectrum of different \r\nstrategies used by websites for ad-block detection. We find that a vast \r\nmajority of publishers on the web use fairly simple passive approaches for \r\nad-block detection. However, we also note that a few websites use \r\nthird-party services, e.g. PageFair, for ad-block detection and response. \r\nThe third-party services use active deception and other sophisticated \r\ntactics to detect ad-blockers.

Many researchers in both HCI and Computer Vision have \r\nproposed different interaction techniques in virtual environment. The most \r\nappealing approach is Natural User Interface (NUI), which replicates real \r\nworld interactions. Recently, there are growing research in 3D hand \r\ntracking using RGB-D camera. This recent trend shows great possibility of \r\nrealizing NUI that allows users to manipulate virtual objects with their \r\nhands. This approach has often made use of data-glove, which is time \r\nconsuming, required special equipment and uncomfortable for the user. The \r\nrecent 3D hand-tracking algorithms could greatly improve the usability for \r\nVR and Augmented Reality(AR).\r\n\r\nIn this survey, we start by stating our views on features that could \r\nlikely improve interaction in VR and AR (mixed) environments, which \r\ninclude intuitive usability, high fidelity interaction, transition between \r\nrealistic based interaction and imagination based interaction, and \r\ncollaborative potential.

However, its traditional way \r\nof production is a laborious process. To create the effect of a target \r\nobject moving on its own, it requires animators to manually move the \r\nobject in small increments and to take one static picture of the object \r\nfor each increment. In addition, stop motion animations nowadays not only \r\nfocus on static frames, but also combine with moving scenes, e.g., \r\nwriting, drawing, and hand interaction such as hand clicks and waves, \r\nwhich allow more interactions between the animators and the objects or the \r\nscenes. In this thesis, we propose a video-based method to create the stop \r\nmotion video, which is capable of animating objects in a more smooth way. \r\nA video editing tool tailored for the new inputs is also implemented. In \r\nour method, animators perform both static frames and moving clips \r\ncontinuously, without extra operations such as shooting and photo/video \r\nmode switching.

Despite this popularity, the \r\ndeployment of HeNBs has also introduced a new set of resource inefficiency \r\nproblems, caused mainly by inter-cell interference and indoor traffic load \r\nfluctuation. A large body of previous work has been devoted to improving the \r\nutilization of network resources in HeNBs, including, frequency planning, time \r\ndivision, power control, and space division. Nevertheless, many problems not \r\naddressed adequately by these studies remain open, in particular those related \r\nto communication overhead, computational complexity, and service quality.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of standardized resource allocation mechanisms for LTE HeNBs, in \r\nthis work we focus on designing effective solutions to the resource allocation \r\nproblem in HeNB networks; and address three operational environments: i) \r\nopen-access enterprise networks, ii) closed-access residential networks, and \r\niii) open-access residential networks.\r\n\r\nFirst, we focus on improving the resource utilization in centrally-controlled \r\nopen-access enterprise networks such as enterprise HeNB networks andWireless \r\nLocal Area Networks (WLAN). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first \r\nto jointly optimize user association, antenna beam selection, link scheduling, \r\nand power adaptation in such networks. We proposed a unified conflict-free \r\nscheduling algorithm, that can be directly implemented in HeNB networks, and \r\nalso designed a coordination protocol, the so-called TD-CSMA protocol to enable \r\ndeployment over uncoordinated WLAN MAC protocol.\r\n\r\nNext, identifying the difficulty of implementing X-2 interfaces among HeNBs, we \r\npropose fully distributed resource allocation solutions for non-cooperative \r\ndistributed closed-access residential networks. We introduced a self-learning \r\nHeNB MAC protocol to mitigate interference by relying on historical user \r\nfeedback. The learning process is modelled as a cluster-structural regret-based \r\nlearning game, where the users within one HeNB form a cluster to share \r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nFinally, we examined the problem of the energy cost of running a massive number \r\nof always-on HeNBs worldwide and focused on designing an energy efficient, \r\nQoS-constrained MAC protocol for cooperative distributed open-access \r\nresidential HeNB networks. Since most previous work has failed to properly \r\nconsider interference mitigation when designing such protocols, we manipulate \r\nuser association and OFDMA scheduling with a combination of interference \r\nmitigation measures.

In this \r\nthesis, we study several approaches to make Wi-Fi fingerprinting highly \r\naccurate. The approaches are to mitigate noisy signal measurement, to fuse \r\ndistance sensor with fingerprinting, and to adaptively learn fingerprint \r\npatterns over time. We will conduct extensive experimental studies to \r\nvalidate the performance of the approaches.\r\n\r\nPrevious fingerprinting positioning based on certain similarity metric \r\noften suffers from ambiguous matching problem of reference points, \r\nresulting in high decision uncertainty. To address this, we propose a \r\nnovel approach based on junction of signal tiles, which are formed based \r\non the first two moments of the signals. The target location is then \r\nconstrained within the junction area. This overcomes position ambiguity \r\nproblem and achieves highly accurate positioning.\r\n\r\nTo further enhance the localization accuracy, we study how to fuse \r\nfingerprint with distance information. Our approach is applicable to a \r\nwide range of sensors (peer-assisted, inertial navigation sensor, beacons, \r\netc.) and wireless fingerprints (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.). By a novel \r\noptimization formulation which jointly fuses distance bounds and measured \r\nfingerprint signals, it achieves low positioning errors even under complex \r\nindoor environment.\r\n\r\nFingerprinting accuracy deteriorates if the AP signals are altered (due to \r\nAP movement, partitioning, etc.). To address this, the signal map needs to \r\nbe adapted overtime. We propose and study a novel clustering-based scheme \r\nwhich can localize targets despite AP alteration, and can identify the \r\naltered APs.

Our aim is to help automate this often \r\ntedious task. We compute the map by optimizing the compatibility of \r\ncorresponding warped image neighborhoods using an adaptation of structural \r\nsimilarity. The optimization is regularized by a thin-plate spline, and may be \r\nguided by a few user-drawn points. We parameterize the map over a halfway \r\ndomain and show that this representation offers many benefits. The map is able \r\nto treat the image pair symmetrically, model simple occlusions continuously, \r\nspan partially overlapping images, and define extrapolated correspondences. \r\nMoreover, it enables direct evaluation of the morph in a pixel shader without \r\nmesh rasterization. We improve the morphs by optimizing quadratic motion paths \r\nand by seamlessly extending content beyond the image boundaries. We parallelize \r\nthe algorithm on a GPU to achieve a responsive interface and demonstrate \r\nchallenging morphs obtained with little effort.\r\n\r\nWhen extending image morphing to video morphing, it presents added challenges. \r\nBecause motions are often unsynchronized, temporal alignment is also necessary. \r\nApplying morphing to individual frames leads to discontinuities, so temporal \r\ncoherence must be considered. Our approach is to optimize a full spatiotemporal \r\nmapping between the two videos. We reduce tedious interactions by letting the \r\noptimization derive the fine-scale map given only sparse userspecified \r\nconstraints. For robustness, the optimization objective examines structural \r\nsimilarity of the video content. We demonstrate the approach on a variety of \r\nvideos, obtaining results using few explicit correspondences.\r\n\r\nWe also explore some adaptive transition functions for image and video \r\nmorphing, and provide users a convenient tool for intuitive control on the \r\ntransition rates, to produce some more interesting results.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 23 September 2014\r\n\r\nTime:                   12:00noon - 2:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3494\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Pedro Sander (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Long Quan (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Huamin Qu\r\n \t\t\tProf. Chiew-Lan Tai\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["EFFICIENT SEMI-AUTOMATIC TECHNIQUES FOR IMAGE AND VIDEO MORPHING"], "lenArticle": 351},

In \r\nthis thesis we consider various kinds of shape matching problems and give \r\na possible direction to solve those problems.\r\n\r\nFirst, we introduce an approximate version of the largest common point set \r\nproblem. The largest common point set problem is a standard problem in \r\npattern matching. For two given point sets, we want to find a \r\ntransformation that matches maximal subsets of each point sets under a \r\ncertain metric. Our algorithm works in the plane and we assume that point \r\nsets move under translations. Bottleneck distance is used for the \r\nsimilarity measure between point sets to overcome a drawback of Hausdorff \r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nSecond, we present an approximation algorithm to return a rigid motion of \r\n3-dimensional Euclidean space for two given convex polyhedra such that the \r\nvolume of the overlap of the polyhedra is maximized.

To approximate a convex polygon, we find a simple \r\nfixed shape such as square, rectangle, or circle that minimizes the area \r\nof the symmetric difference with the polygon under homotheties. A \r\nhomothety is a combined transformation with a translation and a scaling. \r\nBecause of the scaling, our problem is very different from the problem \r\nusing only translation.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we will design and analyze an algorithm to solve these \r\nproblems.

However, the vast amount of content results in an information \r\noverload for users when searching in microblogs. Given the user's search \r\nquery, delivering relevant content is a challenging problem. In this \r\nproposal, we therefore present three complementary approaches to tackle \r\nthe challenges of information retrieval in microblogs.\r\n\r\nFirst, we propose a method to determine the quality of microblog documents \r\n(called \"tweets\"). To model the quality of tweets, we devise a new set of \r\nlink-based features, in addition to content-based features. We examine the \r\nimplicit links between tweets, URLs, hashtags and users, and then propose \r\nnovel metrics to reflect quality-based reputation of websites, hashtags \r\nand users. Our evaluation shows that the proposed features outperform a \r\nbag-of-words representation, while requiring less computational time and \r\nstorage.\r\n\r\nSecond, we present two frameworks to model topics in microblog streams. \r\nTopic modeling is an important facility to manage the topical diversity in \r\nmicroblogs and benefits many applications, such as clustering and ranking. \r\nIn our Multi-faceted Topic Modeling framework, we tackle both the short \r\nlength of tweets and the rich semantics discussed by microblog users. We \r\nfirst perform two semantic enrichment steps to inject additional semantics \r\ninto the short tweets. The Multi-faceted Topic Model is then proposed to \r\nmodel latent topics from the social terms in Twitter, auxiliary terms from \r\nexternal URLs and named entities. In our Geographic Twitter Topic Modeling \r\nframework, we focus on spatial aspects of microblog topics. While early \r\nwork has mainly utilized geo-tagged tweets, we propose a content-based \r\nmethod for extracting location references. The Geographic Twitter Topic \r\nModel is then developed to discover latent topics with two geographic \r\ndimensions, comprising locations at which a topic is discussed and \r\nlocations mentioned within the topic.\r\n\r\nThird, we present a framework for Collaborative Personalized Twitter \r\nSearch. Traditional techniques for personalized Web search are insuffcient \r\nin the microblog domain, because of the diversity of topics, sparseness of \r\nuser data and the highly social nature.

The \nfirst one is path explosion problem. Path explosion is a major issue in \napplying path-sensitive symbolic analysis to large programs. Since real \nworld programs are typically built on top of many library functions, it is \ngenerally impractical to model all APIs and symbolic analysis often \napproximates some APIs' behavior. We observe that many symbolic states \ngenerated by such symbolic analysis of a procedure are indistinguishable \nto its callers. It is, therefore, possible to keep only one state from \neach set of equivalent symbolic states without affecting the analysis \nresult. Based on this observation, we propose an equivalence relation \ncalled z-equivalence, which is weaker than logical equivalence to relate a \nlarge number of z-equivalent states. We prove that z-equivalence is strong \nenough to guarantee that paths to be traversed by the symbolic analysis of \ntwo z-equivalent states are identical, giving the same solutions to \nsatisfiability and validity queries. We propose a sound linear algorithm \nto detect z-equivalence. Our experiments show that the symbolic analysis \nthat leverages z-equivalence is able to achieve more than ten orders of \nmagnitude reduction in terms of search space. The reduction significantly \nalleviates the path explosion problem, enabling us to apply symbolic \nanalysis in large programs such as Hadoop and Linux Kernel.\n\nThe second problem is precision issue. API approximation can induce many \nunreachable symbolic states, which are expensive to validate manually. In \nthe second part of this thesis, we propose a static approach to \nautomatically validating the reported anomalous symbolic states. The \nvalidation makes use of the available runtime data of the un-modeled APIs \ncollected from previous program executions. We show that the symbolic \nstate validation problem can be cast as a MAX-SAT problem and solved by \nexisting constraint solvers. Our technique found 80 unreported bugs when \nit was applied to 10 popular programs with a total of 1.5 million lines of \ncode. All of them can be confirmed by test cases. Our technique presents a \npromising way to apply the big data paradigm to software engineering. It \nprovides a mechanism to validate the symbolic states of a project by \nleveraging the many concrete input-output values of APIs collected from \nother projects.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 29 October 2014\n\nTime:                   10:30am - 12:30pm\n\nVenue:                  Room 4472\n                        lifts 25/26\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf Shing-Chi Cheung (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tDr. Charles Zhang (Chairperson)\n \t\t\tDr. Sunghun Kim\n \t\t\tProf. Fangzhen Lin\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Scalable Symbolic Analysis of Large Real World Programs Using API Abstraction and Execution Histories"], "lenArticle": 426},

In \r\nsponsored search, we investigate contextualized advertising, where \r\nadvertisers have different valuations for different disjoint contexts and \r\nthe number of queries per context is known in advance. When no budget \r\nconstraints exist, we properly adapt the GSP auction, and explore \r\ncombinatorial auctions. When budget constraints are present, we \r\ndistinguish between two cases: advertisers may be indifferent to the price \r\nper click, or they may not be willing to pay more than their valuation. \r\nFor the first case, we utilize a novel probabilistic framework that is \r\ninspired by resource allocation markets. Under reasonable conditions, a \r\nNash equilibrium always exists; to compute it, we introduce three methods \r\nbased on distributed dynamics.  In the second case, we cannot show that a \r\nNash equilibrium always exists, but we manage to bound a player??s most \r\nprofitable deviation using concave relaxations of the utilities. In human \r\ncomputation, we address two fundamental problems in human computation \r\ngames. The first concerns methods for ranking players according to their \r\nskill. We discuss how human computation games are weak-link games, where \r\nlow-skill players have a disproportionately greater impact on the game \r\noutcome. We then develop three ELO-based techniques that consider the \r\nweak-link structure as well as the task difficulty. Moreover, we introduce \r\na Bayesian skill rating system, and show how to perform approximate \r\ninference using Expectation Propagation and a proportional heuristic for \r\nupdating the posterior marginals. The second problem regards the mechanism \r\ndesign for generalizations of the ESP game. We apply Bayesian game theory \r\nto model and analyze how players behave in equilibrium. Our analysis \r\nexplains how rational and strategic players may resort to adversarial \r\nactions to increase their score.

These remarkable technical\r\nadvances have resulted in more and more supermarkets and libraries, such\r\nas Walt-Mart and university libraries, introducing RFID techniques into\r\ntheir traditional systems. Such wide use of RFID technology has spawned\r\nexciting new research initiatives. RFID-based localization has currently\r\nbecome one of the hottest research topics in the RFID field. RFID-based\r\nlocalization technology benefits from the wide deployment of RFID systems,\r\nwhich means less additional deployment is needed when performing\r\nlocalization processes.

Learning the hidden patterns from such mobile data can \r\nhelp understand the contexts and facts about individual, social group, \r\ncommunity, and urban environment, and hence is an important task in both \r\nartificial intelligence and mobile computing. In this proposal, we study how to \r\nbuild effective analytical and predictive models of human behavior contexts and \r\nurban dynamics, which is crucial in building context-aware ubiquitous systems \r\nand enabling smart-city applications.\r\n\r\nIn the first part, we propose effective learning methods to capture useful \r\nbehavior contexts from human mobile data, including personal mobility behaviors \r\nand social interaction behaviors, to enable exploratory, inference, and \r\npredictive purposes. The methods are designed to address several typical \r\nchallenges in mobile data, namely the presence of noise and sparsity, and the \r\nabsence of semantic labels. For personal mobility behaviors, we first propose a \r\nBayesian network to discover the routine behavior pattern from a single user's \r\ntime-stamped mobility traces. Based on such, we then propose non-trivial \r\nextensions to address the difficult problem of representing mobility habits of \r\nmultiple individuals in a unified way. To address the challenge that multiple \r\nindividuals rarely have spatial overlap or social connections in their \r\nmobility, we leverage the observation that temporal structures in habits can be \r\nhighly shared across individuals. We design two methods based on novel \r\nextensions of matrix factorization and hierarchical Dirichlet processes to \r\nrealize such population models, and demonstrate how they help solve several \r\nchallenging pervasive tasks, including routine behavior pattern discovery from \r\nvery sparse mobility data, individual mobility prediction under cold-start \r\ncondition, and organizational rhythm discovery. To show the generality of the \r\nmethod, we also apply it to Bluetooth data to discover social circles semantics \r\nfor human social behavior characterization and social event prediction.\r\n\r\nIn the second part, we propose effective methods to learn road latent cost from \r\nhistorical taxi trajectory data for urban sensing. Road latent cost quantifies \r\nhow desirable each road is for traveling, and is a good representation of \r\ndriving experience and urban dynamics. We first study how to robustly estimate \r\nthe temporal dynamics of road travel time under temporal sparsity by exploiting \r\ntemporal smoothness in a multi-task regression framework. In addition to travel \r\ntime, a plenty of other hidden factors may influence the desirability of a \r\nroad, but are impossible to obtain in practice. To address this, we propose to \r\nlearn road latent cost from entire trajectories by modeling drivers' routing \r\ndecisions based on inverse reinforcement learning, while at the same time \r\nproperly considering the heterogeneity of destinations so that trajectories \r\nwith different goals can be learned jointly. In addition, observing that real \r\ntrajectory data often contains a few anomalous trajectories, we design a sparse \r\nnoise-oriented robust inverse reinforcement learning framework which can \r\nautomatically identify and remove anomalies in cost learning. Real data \r\nexperiments show that compared with past edge-centric approaches, the road \r\nlatent costs learned in our way are more useful and robust in facilitating \r\ntypical smart-city applications, and require less data for learning.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 28 November 2014\r\n\r\nTime:                   9:00am - 11:00am\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Lionel Ni (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Huamin Qu (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo\r\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Effective Learning from Mobile Data for Human Behavior and Urban Dynamics Sensing and Prediction"], "lenArticle": 581},

They represent complex relationships among \nobserved variables and yet are computationally simple to work with. When \nused for data analysis, they can identify meaningful groupings of observed \nvariables, where the correlations among the variables in each group can be \nmodeled by a single latent variable. As such, LTMs are effective tools for \ndetecting correlation patterns in data and can be applied to various \ndomains. In this thesis, we focus on developing new algorithms for \nlearning latent tree models and investigating their use in two \napplications.\n\nFirstly, we propose a new method called Bridged-Islands (BI) algorithm for \nlearning latent tree models. Many algorithms have been proposed for the \nsame task. However, previous methods for learning latent tree models have \ntheir limitations. For example, the search algorithms can only handle data \nsets with dozens of attributes which limits their use in processing large \ndata set. The algorithms based on attribute clustering (AC) usually focus \non latent tree models with special structures (e.g., binary trees or \nforests) which may be not appropriate for many real world applications. \nThe algorithms motivated by phylogenetic tree reconstruction (PTR) have \nrestrictions on both observed and latent variables. They normally require \nthat all observed or latent variables have the same number of states and \nthe number should be known beforehand. Compared with AC-based algorithms \nand PTR-motivated algorithms, the advantage of BI algorithm is model \nquality. It produces models with better quality and has no restrictions on \nthe cardinalities of the observed variables or latent variables. Compared \nwith search algorithms, BI is more efficient and can be employed in larger \ndata sets.\n\nSecondly, we propose a new LTM-based algorithm called hierarchical latent \ntree analysis (HLTA) for identifying topics from a collection of \ndocuments. The predominant method for topic detection are latent Dirichlet \nallocation (LDA), which assume a generating process for the documents. \nHLTA provides an alternative view for topic detection. It identifies the \ntopics by simultaneously clustering the documents and word variables. In \nthis new view, a topic is considered as a class of documents that show \nclear thematic meaning. The new method models the word co-occurrence \npatterns by using a hierarchical latent tree model. Each latent variable \nrepresents a soft partition of the documents based on some word \nco-occurrence patterns. Each state of the latent variable, which \nrepresents a cluster of documents in the partition, is interpreted as a \ntopic. In the hierarchical structure, the variables at a higher level \ncorrespond to more general topics, while the variables at a lower level \ncorrespond to more specific topics. Compared with alternative methods, \nHLTA integrates topic correlation modeling, topic structure detection and \nautomatic determination of topic numbers in one framework. Empirical \nexperiments also show that the new algorithm produces more semantically \ncoherent topics and topic hierarchy than LDA-based methods.\n\nThirdly, we explore the use of LTMs for multidimensional clustering. \nConventional clustering usually assume that there is only one true \nclustering within a data set, which does not hold for many real-world data \nthat are multifaceted. Multidimensional clustering aims to identify \nmultiple clusterings from the data. Latent tree models have previously \nbeen used for multidimensional clustering, where each latent variable in \nthe model represents one way to cluster the data. In this thesis, we apply \nthe new algorithm to the task and simultaneously deal with much larger \ndata sets than previously. We compared LTM-based methods with several \nalternative algorithms for multidimensional clustering on both labeled and \nunlabeled data sets. The empirical experiments indicate that the LTM-based \nmethods can identify a rich set of meaningful clusterings and concurrently \nachieve good performance.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 1 December 2014\n\nTime:                   9:30am - 11:30am\n\nVenue:                  Room 3501\n                        lifts 25/26\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Nevin Zhang (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung (Chairperson)\n \t\t\tDr. Huamin Qu\n \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Accelerated Learning of Latent Tree Models for Topic Detection and Multidimensional Clustering"], "lenArticle": 671},

It is the basis for the various analysis tasks that are \nsubsequently performed on the catalog products.  With the rapid progress \nof new, large astronomical projects, observational images will be produced \nevery few seconds. This high speed of image production requires fast \nsource extraction. Unfortunately, current source extraction tools cannot \nmeet the online  processing requirement.\n\nIn this thesis work, we propose to use the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) \nto accelerate source extraction. Specifically, we start from SExtractor, \nan astronomical source extraction tool widely used in astronomy projects, \nand study its parallelization on the GPU. In our GPU-SExtractor, we \nre-design and parallelize the three major steps of SExtractor: 1) \nBackground Computation, 2) Multi-Threshold Object Detection and 3) Object \nAnalysis. In particular, we identify the Multi-Threshold Object Detection \nstep as the most complex and time-consuming, and design a parallel \ndetection algorithm based on Connected-Component Labelling. Furthermore, \nwe apply compaction techniques to optimize the detection algorithm to \nbetter utilize the massive GPU thread parallelism. In the Object Analysis \nstep, we decompose the analysis into a sequence of GPU-friendly \ndata-parallel primitives to compute the attributes of each extracted \nobject. We have evaluated our GPU-SExtractor in comparison with the \noriginal SExtractor on a desktop with an Intel i7 CPU and an NVIDIA GTX670 \nGPU on a set of real-world and synthetic astronomical images of different \nsizes.

Our aim is to help automate this \noften tedious task. We compute the map by optimizing the compatibility of \ncorresponding warped image neighborhoods using an adaptation of structural \nsimilarity. The optimization is regularized by a thin-plate spline, and \nmay be guided by a few user-drawn points. We parameterize the map over a \nhalfway domain and show that this representation offers many benefits. The \nmap is able to treat the image pair symmetrically, model simple occlusions \ncontinuously, span partially overlapping images, and define extrapolated \ncorrespondences. Moreover, it enables direct evaluation of the morph in a \npixel shader without mesh rasterization. We improve the morphs by \nseamlessly extending content beyond the image boundaries.

Our approach is \nto optimize a full spatiotemporal mapping between the two videos. We \nreduce tedious interactions by letting the optimization derive the \nfine-scale map given only sparse userspecified constraints. For \nrobustness, the optimization objective examines structural similarity of \nthe video content.

The telecommunication \nindustry and international standardization bodies have placed considerable \nattention to the deployment of extremely dense networks, referred to as \nDenseNets, which creates a bundle of opportunities for high spatial reuse and \nenergy efficiency by reducing the distance between Access Points (APs) and \nclients. Industrial practices of DenseNets include small-scale femtocells in \nLTE/LTE-A based cellular systems and WiFi hotspots in public places in IEEE \n802.11 based High Efficiency WLAN (HEW). Both empirical experiences and \ntheoretical analyses suggest that DenseNets will encompass significant \ntechnical challenges related to reliable and efficient access and management. \nOn the one hand, DenseNets contain a significant number of densely-deployed APs \nwith highly overlapped regions, making network maintenance a complicated and \nchallenging task. On the other hand, there are normally a crowd of clients in \nDenseNets, and thus efficient access control is expected to meet the high \nper-user-throughput demands with a limited amount of bandwidth.\n\nWe have two proposals for DenseNets, where each aims to address one challenge \nas mentioned above. First, we propose a automatic fault management framework \nfor dense femtocell networks. Under this framework, we propose three system \ndesigns for outage detection, fault diagnosis, and self-healing functions. As \nthe first step of our automatic management framework, the proposed outage \ndetection design exploits signal correlations among multiple femtocells to \nimprove detection accuracy for small-size densely-deployed femtocell networks. \nThe outage detection system triggers fault diagnostic system. In our diagnostic \nsystem design, we develop a transfer learning based approach to overcome the \ndata scarcity issue in small-size femtocells. After identifying the specific \nfault, outage is compensated by a self-healing scheme.

The risk of spectrum crutch, \nwhere the user demand outstrips the available spectrum, motivates the \nresearch on dynamic access to improve the usage of the under-utilized \nspectrum. In addition, video streaming has dominated the wireless traffic, \nand it is important to understand video Quality-of-Experience to \nefficiently improve video service quality over wireless network.\n\nIn this thesis, we first study the spectrum management for dynamic \nspectrum access networks from three aspects: spectrum auction, spectrum \nallocation between licensed and unlicensed use, and hybrid access in \nfemtocell networks. We identify the challenges under each scenario, and \npropose solutions to address the problem. Then, we conduct a measurement \nstudy to analyze video Quality-of-Experience, represented by \nQuality-of-Engagement (QoE), in wireless network based on a real-world \ndata set.\n\nFor the spectrum auction, we propose two mechanisms. First, we design a \ndouble auction mechanism for heterogeneous spectrums, dealing with the \nproblem of heterogeneous interference graphs and heterogeneous buyers' \nvaluations. Second, we design an online double auction mechanism for \ndynamic spectrum access, taking into consideration the location-determined \ninterference relationship among buyers. For the spectrum allocation \nbetween licensed and unlicensed use, we build a three-stage game model to \ncharacterize the interaction among the spectrum regulator, the licensed \nand the unlicensed operators, and the end users. The target is a balance \nof allocation income for the spectrum regulator and social welfare for the \nend users. For the hybrid access in femtocell networks, we establish a \nutility-aware refunding framework, in which the macrocell operator refunds \nthe femtocell owners for sharing their femtocell resources.  All of the \nabove studies achieve a more efficient utilization of the spectrum \nresources in the dynamic spectrum access networks.\n\nFor the measurement study on video QoE over the wireless network, we \ndeploy an experimental platform to collect video session data and conduct \na survey to solicit users' subjective opinions.

While RFID is \r\na relatively old technology, more recent advancements in chip manufacturing \r\ntechnology are making RFID practical for new applications and settings, \r\nparticularly object localization, human activity sensing and consumer item \r\nlevel tagging. These advancements have the potential to revolutionize \r\nsupply-chain management, inventory control, and human computer interaction. In \r\nthis thesis, we focus on developing new algorithms for fine-grained object \r\nlocalization and human activity sensing based on passive RFIDs.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we propose a new method for luggage order tracking based on the \r\nsignals features backscattered from passive tags. In many logistics \r\napplications, luggage attached with tags are placed on moving conveyor belts \r\nfor processing. It is important to figure out the order of goods on the belts \r\nso that further actions like sorting can be accurately taken on proper goods. \r\nDue to arbitrary goods placement or the irregularity of wireless signal \r\npropagation, neither of the order of tag identification nor the received signal \r\nstrength provides sufficient evidence on their relative positions on the belts. \r\nIn this study, we establish a probabilistic model for recognizing the transient \r\ncritical region and propose the OTrack protocol to continuously monitor the \r\norder of tags. we evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness through a one-month \r\nexperiment conducted through a working conveyor at Beijing Capital \r\nInternational Airport.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we propose a new method for RFID based relative object localization. \r\nAlthough many schemes for object localization using Radio Frequency \r\nIdentification (RFID) tags have been proposed, they mostly focus on absolute \r\nobject localization and are not suitable for relative object localization \r\nbecause of large error margins and the special hardware that they require. We \r\npropose an approach called Spatial-Temporal Phase Profiling (STPP) to RFID \r\nbased relative object localization. The basic idea of STPP is that by moving a \r\nreader over a set of tags, for each tag, the reader obtains a sequence of RF \r\nphase values, which we call a phase profile. By analyzing the spatial-temporal \r\ndynamics in the phase profiles, STPP can calculate the spatial ordering among \r\nthe tags. STPP requires neither dedicated infrastructure nor special hardware. \r\nWe implemented STPP and evaluated its performance in two real-world \r\napplications: locating misplaced books in a library and sorting baggage in an \r\nairport.\r\n\r\nThirdly, we propose a new sensing scheme for free-weight exercise monitoring \r\nbased on passive RFIDs. Regular free-weight exercise helps to strengthen the \r\nbody's natural movements and stabilize muscles that are important to strength, \r\nbalance, and posture of human beings. Prior works have exploited wearable \r\nsensors or RF signal changes (e.g., WiFi and Blue-tooth) for activity sensing, \r\nrecognition and counting etc. However, none of them have incorporate three key \r\nfactors necessary for a practical free-weight exercise monitoring system: \r\nrecognizing free-weight activities on site, assessing their qualities, and \r\nproviding useful feedbacks to the bodybuilder promptly. Our FEMO system \r\nresponds to these needs, providing an integrated free-weight exercise \r\nmonitoring that incorporates all the essential functionalities mentioned above. \r\nWe implement FEMO with COTS RFID systems and conduct a two-weeks experiment. \r\nThe preliminary result from 15 volunteers demonstrates that FEMO can be applied \r\nto a variety of free-weight activities and users.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 15 January 2015\r\n\r\nTime:                   3:00pm - 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3494\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Ke Yi (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Kai Chen (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lin Gu\r\n \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Context-awareness sensing with RFID"], "lenArticle": 579},

Traditional interactive \ntechniques such as lasso selection, snapping and arrangement commands are \nprovided by most graphic editors to aid the users in accomplishing these \ntasks. However, these techniques are often oblivious of the underlying \npatterns of the elements, requiring the users to perform explicit and \ntedious operations to achieve the goal of the manipulation. It is expected \nthat the amount of user interaction can be reduced by exploiting the \npatterns of the elements. Nevertheless, designing effective pattern-aware \ninteraction tools is challenging due to the ambiguities in the patterns \nrepresented by the elements and the operations issued by the user.\n\nThis thesis focuses on developing effective pattern-aware interactive \ntechniques to aid the users in the selection and arrangement of elements.\nIn particular, we propose three interactive techniques which adopt \ndifferent strategies to resolve the ambiguities arose during manipulation.\n\nFirst, we introduce a selection tool called Lazy Selection. It is a \nscribble-based tool for quick selection of one or more desired shape \nelements by roughly stroking through the elements. Our algorithm \nautomatically refines the selection and reveals the user's intention. It \nfirst extracts selection candidates from the scribble-covered elements by \nexamining the underlying patterns and then ranks them based on their \nlocation and shape with respect to the user-sketched scribble. Such a \ndesign makes this tool tolerant to imprecise input systems and applicable \nto touch systems without suffering from the fat finger problem.\n\nSecond, we present GACA, a group-aware command-based arrangement tool. \nCompared with the traditional command-based arrangement tools, it reduces \nthe numbers of selection operation and command invocation. The key idea is \nthat an issued arrangement command is in fact very informative, \ninstructing the command how to automatically decompose a 2D layout into \nmultiple 1D groups, each of which being compatible with the command. We \npresent a parameter-free, command-driven grouping approach so that users \ncan easily predict our grouping results. We also design a simple user \ninterface to enable explicit control of grouping and arrangement.\n\nThird, we present a framework for automatic global beautification of \nlayouts. To facilitate ambiguity resolution in layout beautification, we\npresent a novel user interface for visualizing and editing inferred \nrelationships. Our interface provides a preview of the beautified layout \nwith inferred constraints, without directly modifying the input layout. In \nthis way, the user can easily keep refining beautification results by \ninteractively repositioning and/or resizing elements in the input layout. \nIn addition, we present a gestural interface for editing automatically \ninferred constraints by directly interacting with the visualized \nconstraints via simple gestures.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 26 January 2015\n\nTime:\t\t\t3:00pm - 5:00pm\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3494\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Jiang Xu (ECE)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Chiew-Lan Tai (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Lei Chen\n \t\t\tProf. Albert Chung\n \t\t\tProf. Ajay Joneja (IELM)\n \t\t\tProf. Pheng-Ann Heng (Comp.

GeoSNs have created a fertile ground for novel location-based social \ninteractions, advertising and market analysis. In this proposal we introduce: \ni) a general framework for Geo-Social query processing, ii) GeoSN queries, \nwhich extract useful information combining both the social relationships and \nthe current location of the users, iii) Geo-Social Ranking (GSR) problem that \nranks the users based on their social and spatial attributes, and iv) Real-Time \nMulti-criteria Graph Partitioning (RMGP) task for partitioning the social graph \nof a GeoSN.\n\nInitially, we propose a general framework for Geo-Social query processing that \noffers flexible data management and algorithmic design. It segregates the \nsocial, geographical and query processing modules. Then, each GeoSN query is \nprocessed via a transparent combination of primitive queries issued to the \nsocial and geographical modules. We demonstrate the power of our framework by \nintroducing several \"basic\" and \"advanced\" query types, and devising various \nsolutions for each type.\n\nGSR ranks the users of a GeoSN based on their distance to a given query \nlocation q, the number of their friends in the vicinity of q, and possibly the \nconnectivity of those friends. We propose four GSR functions that assign scores \nin different ways: i) LC, which is a weighted linear combination of social \n(i.e., friendships) and spatial (i.e., distance to q) aspects, ii) RC, which is \na ratio combination of the two aspects, iii) HGS, which considers the number of \nfriends in coincident circles centered at q, and iv) GST, which takes into \naccount triangles of friends in the vicinity of q. We investigate the behavior \nof the functions, qualitatively assess their results, and study the effects of \ntheir parameters. Moreover, for each ranking function, we design a query \nprocessing technique that utilizes its specific characteristics to efficiently \nretrieve the top-k users.\n\nRMGP groups the users based on their social connectivity and their distance to \na set of input geographical points that represent the locations of social \nevents. We consider RMGP as an on-line graph partitioning task, which may be \nfrequently performed for different query parameters (e.g., social events). In \norder to overcome the serious performance issues associated with the large \nsocial graphs found in practice, we develop solutions based on a game theoretic \nframework. Specifically, we consider each user as a player, whose goal is to \nfind the class that optimizes his objective function. We propose algorithms \nbased on best-response dynamics and analyze their properties.\n\nFinally, we perform an exhaustive experimental evaluation for all proposed \nmethods with real and synthetic datasets in centralized and decentralized \nsettings.

Due to its low \nfalse positives and high branch coverages, DSE has received much interest \nboth in industry and academia. However, one of the biggest challenges in \nDSE is the path explosion. The number of execution paths increases \nexponentially to the number of branches in a program and exploring all \npaths with DSE becomes infeasible even for a medium sized program. To \nefficiently explore the search space of DSE, we present two search \nstrategies. The Context Guided-Search strategy aims to achieve a high \nbranch coverage fast. The key idea behind the CGS is to focus on exploring \ndiverse states of the program by selecting branches in a new context \nfirst. We use dominator information to exclude irrelevant branches from \nthe context information and incrementally increase the consideration level \nof context. On the other hand, the Precondition Guided-Search strategy \naims to generate inputs to cover a specific target branch. The PGS \nstrategy calculates preconditions for not reaching the target branch from \nprevious execution paths which failed to reach the target branch. The PGS \nstrategy builds the preconditions in a bottom-up manner with incremental \nmerge and uses the preconditions to reduce the search space.\nThe evaluation results show that the CGS strategy can cover more branches \nthan other search strategies on various subjects and the PGS strategy can \ncover the target branch which cannot be covered easily by other \nstrategies.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 28 January 2015\n\nTime:\t\t\t1:30pm - 3:30pm\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 4472\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Christopher Leung (CIVL)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Sunghun Kim (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung\n \t\t\tProf. Charles Zhang\n \t\t\tProf. Li Qiu (ECE)\n \t\t\tProf. Cristian Cadar (Comp., Imperial College London)\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Context and Precondition-Guided Search Strategies in Dynamic Symbolic Execution"], "lenArticle": 325},

Researchers have proposed many defect prediction algorithms and \nmetrics. However, software defect prediction has a limitation that it is \ndifficult to build prediction models on software projects with limited \nhistorical data such as defect information.\n\nTo overcome this limitation, we propose three techniques that can build \nprediction models on projects with limited historical data.

Sensing via WiFi enables\r\nremote sensing without wearable sensors and contactless sensing in\r\nprivacy-preserving mode, which are beneficial in a range of applications\r\nincluding security surveillance, intrusion detection, elderly monitoring,\r\nand human-computer interaction. For WiFi sensing to excel indoors,\r\nmultipath propagation acts as a major concern. The multipath effect can\r\ninvalidate theoretical propagation models, distort received signal\r\nsignatures, and fundamentally constrain the performance of wireless\r\nsensing even when inferring the presence of humans. To explicitly\r\neliminate any adverse impact of multipath propagation, researchers resort\r\nto customized signals and specialized USRP radios for radar-like signal\r\nprocessing. To enable device-free applications on commodity\r\ninfrastructures, existing approaches exploit a dense deployment of\r\nwireless links.\r\n\r\nInstead of avoiding multipath, in this study, we demonstrate it is\r\npossible to harness multipath in WiFi sensing with the PHY layer Channel\r\nState Information (CSI). In the first work, we design a pervasive\r\nprimitive to identify the availability of the LOS path under multipath\r\npropagation with only commodity WiFi devices to improve the multipath\r\nawareness in WiFi sensing. In the second work, we exploit the rich\r\nmultipath effect as fingerprints to blur the directional coverage of\r\ntraditional passive human detection architecture to achieve\r\nomnidirectional coverage. In the third work, we propose a measurable\r\nmetric as proxy for detection sensitivity and a lightweight subcarrier and\r\npath configuration scheme to adapt to different multipath propagation\r\nconditions. We prototype the above three schemes with commodity WiFi\r\ninfrastructure, and evaluate their performances in typical office\r\nenvironments. Experimental results demonstrate improved detection accuracy\r\nand coverage even in multipath-dense scenarios compared with MAC layer\r\nRSSI based schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 6 February 2015\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3494\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Lionel Ni (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Gary Chan\r\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Boosting WiFi Sensing with Physical Layer Information"], "lenArticle": 335},

However, many mobile applications on market suffer \nfrom bugs that can cause significant energy waste and performance \ndegradation, thereby losing their competitive edge. Locating these bugs is \nlabor-intensive and thus automated diagnosis is highly desirable. \nUnfortunately, people have limited understanding of these bugs and there \nare no clear criteria to facilitate automated energy efficiency or \nperformance analysis. To bridge the gap, we conducted two large-scale \nempirical studies of real energy and performance bugs from popular Android \napplications. We studied the characteristics of these bugs and identified \nseveral common causes of energy waste and performance degradation.\n\nFor energy bugs, we observed that (1) forgetting to deactivate device \nsensors or wake locks after use and (2) ineffectively utilizing sensory \ndata can cause serious energy waste. To help developers detect such energy \nbugs, we proposed a dynamic analysis technique GreenDroid. GreenDroid \nautomatically generates user interaction event sequences to systematically \nexecute an Android application for state space exploration. During \nexecution, it tracks the transformation, propagation and consumption of \nsensory data and analyzes whether the data are effectively utilized by the \napplication to bring users perceptible benefits. It also closely monitors \nwhether sensors and wake locks are properly deactivated after use. We \nevaluated GreenDroid using 13 popular open-source Android applications. \nGreenDroid successfully located 12 real energy bugs in these applications \nand additionally found two unreported bugs that were later confirmed by \ndevelopers.\n\nFor performance bugs, we observed that (1) conducting lengthy operations \nin an application's main thread and (2) frequently invoking heavy-weight \nprogram callbacks can seriously reduce the responsiveness of an \napplication. To help developers detect such performance bugs, we designed \na light-weight static analysis technique PerfChecker. PerfChecker \nautomatically scans an Android application's bytecode and identifies a set \nof checkpoints whose efficiency is critical. It then analyzes whether the \ncheckpoints' implementation satisfies the efficiency rules formulated from \nour empirical study. We conducted two case studies to evaluate \nPerfChecker. In the first study, we applied PerfChecker to analyze 29 \npopular open-source Android applications, which comprise 1.1 million lines \nof Java code. PerfChecker successfully detected 126 previously unknown \nperformance bugs, among which 68 were quickly confirmed by developers and \n20 critical ones were fixed soon afterwards. In the second study, we \napplied PerfChecker to analyze 10 popular commercial Android applications \nand one widely-used library. PerfChecker also successfully located 52 \nunreported performance bugs, of which 20 were confirmed by the \ncorresponding developer teams.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 10 February 2015\n\nTime:\t\t\t10:30am - 12:30pm\n\nVenue: \t\t\tRoom 3494\n\t\t\tlifts 25/26\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung (Supervisor)\n\t\t\tDr. Charles Zhang (Chairperson)\n \t\t      \tDr. Sunghun Kim\n \t\t      \tDr. Jogesh Muppala\n\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Automated Analysis of Energy Efficiency and Execution Performance for Mobile Applications"], "lenArticle": 464},

To \nsafeguard their quality, newly submitted patches typically go through a series \nof quality assurance steps, such as code review and testing, before they can be \nintegrated into the code base. Despite the wide adoption of code review and \ntesting, little empirical knowledge of patch quality from software \npractitioners' perspective has been provided. Consequently, targeted tool \nsupport for improving patch quality is hindered.\n\nIn this dissertation, we present empirical investigations on software \npractitioners' perspective of patch quality. First, we conduct a large-scale \nexploratory study with Microsoft engineers to investigate industrial practice \nin understanding patches. Second, by inspecting Eclipse and Mozilla patches and \nsurveying their developers, we investigate why patches are rejected by code \nreviewers and the severity of patch-rejection reasons.\n\nBased on our empirical findings, we propose approaches to improve the quality \nof a software patch in terms of its atomicity and completeness. First, we \ncombine program slicing and pattern matching techniques to automatically \ndecompose non-atomic patches. Our approach renders promising results in both \nquantitative and qualitative evaluation. Second, we propose a two-phase model \nto predict files to be included in a bug-fix patch. Our model outperforms three \nother prediction models and on average 70% of its predictions point to the \ncorrect files.\n\nIn addition to human-written patches, we also investigate the quality of \nautomatically generated patches produced by program repair techniques. We \nconduct a large-scale human study, in which 95 software practitioners use \nautomatically generated patches as debugging aids. Our regression analysis on \n337 data points reveals the impact of patch quality on debugging performance, \nwhile our qualitative analysis on participants' feedback provides further \ninsights on how to effectively apply automatically generated patches.\n\nThe primary contribution of this dissertation includes 1) in-depth empirical \ninvestigations to reveal software practitioners' perspective of patch quality; \n2) approaches to improve patch atomicity and completeness; and 3) a human study \nto explore the impact of the quality of automatically generated patches under \nthe context of debugging.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 11 February 2015\n\nTime:                   3:30pm - 5:30pm\n\nVenue:                  Room 4483\n                        lifts 25/26\n\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Sunghun Kim (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tDr. Charles Zhang (Chairperson)\n \t\t\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung\n \t\t\tProf. Frederick Lochovsky\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Recovering Latent Expert Knowledge of Software Patch Quality"], "lenArticle": 384},

Learning the hidden patterns from such mobile data can \nhelp understand the contexts and facts about individual, social group, \ncommunity, and urban environment, and hence is an important task in both \nartificial intelligence and mobile computing. In this dissertation, we study \nhow to build effective analytical and predictive models of human behavior \ncontexts and urban dynamics, which is crucial in building context-aware \nubiquitous systems and enabling smart-city applications.\n\nIn the first part, we design effective learning methods to capture semantic \nbehavior contexts from human mobile data, including personal mobility data and \nsocial interaction data. Our modeling methods contrast with existing approaches \nin that we address several typical challenges in real world mobile data \njointly, including the presence of noise and data sparsity, and the absence of \nsemantic labels, as well as enable exploratory, inference, and predictive \npurposes in a unified framework. For personal mobility data, we first design a \nBayesian network to discover the routine behavior pattern from a single user's \ntime-stamped mobility traces. Based on such, we then make non-trivial \nextensions\nto address the difficult problem of representing mobility habits of multiple \nindividuals in a unified way. To address the key challenge that multiple \nindividuals rarely have spatial overlap or social connections in their \nmobility, we leverage the observation that temporal structures in habits can be \nhighly shared across individuals. We design two methods based on novel \nextensions of matrix factorization and hierarchical Dirichlet processes to \nrealize such population mobility models, and demonstrate how they help solve \nseveral challenging pervasive tasks, including routine behavior pattern \ndiscovery from sparse mobility data, individual mobility prediction under \ncold-start condition, and organizational rhythm discovery. We also apply \nsimilar methods to Bluetooth proximity data to discover social circles \nsemantics for human social behavior characterization and social event \nprediction.\n\nIn the second part, we design effective methods to learn road latent cost from \nhistorical taxi trajectory data for urban sensing. Road latent cost quantifies \nhow desirable each road is for traveling, and is a good representation of \ndriving experience and urban dynamics. We first study how to robustly estimate \nthe temporal dynamics of road travel time cost under temporal sparsity by \nexploiting temporal smoothness in a multi-task regression framework. This \ncontrasts with existing work which either ignores such temporal dynamics or \nassumes it as a known function. In addition to travel time, a plenty of other \nhidden factors may influence the desirability of a road, but are impossible to \nobtain in practice. To address this, we propose to learn road latent cost from \nentire trajectories by modeling drivers' routing decisions based on inverse\nreinforcement learning, while at the same time properly considering the \nheterogeneity of destinations so that trajectories with different goals can be \nlearned jointly. In addition, observing that real trajectory data often \ncontains a few anomalous trajectories, we design a sparse noise-oriented robust \ninverse reinforcement learning framework which can automatically identify and \nremove anomalies in cost learning. Real data experiments show that compared \nwith past edge-centric approaches and noise-indifferent approaches, the road \nlatent costs learned in our way are more useful and robust in facilitating \ntypical smart-city applications, and require less data for learning.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 13 February 2015\n\nTime:\t\t\t3:00pm - 5:00pm\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3494\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Howard Luong (ECE)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Lionel Ni (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Qiong Luo\n \t\t\tProf. Raymond Wong\n \t\t\tProf. Jian-Ping Gan (MATH)\n \t\t\tProf. Jiannong Cao (Computing, PolyU)\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Effective Learning from Mobile Data for Human Behavior and Urban Dynamics Sensing and Prediction"], "lenArticle": 637},

However, \nthe vast amount of content results in an information overload when searching in \nmicroblogs. Given the user's search query, delivering relevant content is a \nchallenging problem. In this thesis, we therefore present three complementary \napproaches to tackle the challenges of microblog search.\n\nFirst, we propose a method to determine the quality of microblog documents \n(called \"tweets\"). To model the quality of tweets, we devise a set of \nlink-based features, in addition to content-based features. Novel metrics are \nproposed to reflect quality-based reputation of websites, hashtags and users.\n\nSecond, we present two frameworks to model topics discussed in microblogs. In \nour Multi-faceted Topic Modeling framework, we tackle both the short length of \ntweets and the rich semantics discussed by microblog users. We first perform \nsemantic enrichment to inject additional semantics into the short tweets. We \nthen model latent topics that comprise the social terms in Twitter, auxiliary \nterms from external URLs and named entities. In our Geographic Twitter Topic \nModeling framework, we focus on spatial aspects of microblog topics. We propose \na content-based method for extracting locations from tweets and model the rich \ninterplay between microblog topics and locations.\n\nThird, we present a framework for Collaborative Personalized Twitter Search. \nTraditional techniques for personalized Web search are insufficient in the \nmicroblog domain, because of the diversity of topics, sparseness of user data \nand the highly social nature. Our framework introduces a topic-aware user model \nstructure to manage topical diversity.

Data \r\ncenters consist of tens of thousands of servers mutually interconnected via \r\nhigh speed network interconnects, running a large number of applications \r\nserving a huge number of users simultaneously. As such most often these \r\napplications adopt a multi-tiered design model where several services residing \r\non distributed servers work together to satisfy a single client request.

In \r\nparticular we will focus on network congestion, as it is one of the major \r\nproblems in communication networks, and review the three major categories of \r\ncongestion control mechanisms proposed for the Internet.

We \nexplore the former problem in sponsored search advertising, and the latter \nin human computation. In sponsored search, we study the assignment problem \nfor context-based advertising, where advertisers have different valuations \nfor different disjoint contexts. When no budget constraints exist, we show \nhow the corresponding assignment problem can be decomposed into a set of \ndisjoint assignment problems (one for each context). We subsequently \naddress each of the disjoint problems using well-studied mechanisms, such \nas the truthful and socially optimal VCG auction or the industrially \npopular GSP procedure. Furthermore, we explore combinatorial auctions as a \nway to guarantee the search engine revenue. When budget constraints are \npresent, we distinguish between two cases: advertisers may be indifferent \nto the price per click, or they may not be willing to pay more than their \nvaluation. For the first case, we introduce a probabilistic framework from \nresource allocation markets. Under reasonable conditions, a Nash \nequilibrium always exists. To compute it, we introduce three methods that \ncorrespond to different families of distributed dynamics.  In the second \ncase, we cannot show that a Nash equilibrium always exists, but we manage \nto bound a player's most profitable deviation using concave relaxations of \nthe utilities.\n\nIn human computation, we address ranking in human computation games. We \ndiscuss how human computation games have the weak-link property, i.e., the \ngame outcome is determined by low-skill players. To perform ranking, we \ndevelop three classes of scoring/rating algorithms. The first class is an \nELO-based scheme, where players get rewarded if they perform better than \nexpected, or punished in the opposite case. The second class introduces a \nBayesian skill rating system; player ratings can then be computed by \nperforming approximate inference. The third class utilizes results from \nitem response theory, a family of latent trait models that are used to \nestablish psychometric properties of items.

The first \none is path explosion problem. Path explosion is a major issue in applying \npath-sensitive symbolic analysis to large programs. Since real world programs \nare typically built on top of many library functions, it is generally \nimpractical to model all APIs and symbolic analysis often approximates some \nAPIs' behavior. We observe that many symbolic states generated by such symbolic \nanalysis of a procedure are indistinguishable to its callers. It is, therefore, \npossible to keep only one state from each set of equivalent symbolic states \nwithout affecting the analysis result. Based on this observation, we propose an \nequivalence relation called z-equivalence, which is weaker than logical \nequivalence to relate a large number of z-equivalent states. We prove that \nz-equivalence is strong enough to guarantee that paths to be traversed by the \nsymbolic analysis of two z-equivalent states are identical, giving the same \nsolutions to satisfiability and validity queries. We propose a sound linear \nalgorithm to detect z-equivalence. Our experiments show that the symbolic \nanalysis that leverages z-equivalence is able to achieve more than ten orders \nof magnitude reduction in terms of search space. The reduction significantly \nalleviates the path explosion problem, enabling us to apply symbolic analysis \nin large programs such as Hadoop and Linux Kernel.\n\nThe second problem is precision issue. API approximation can induce many \nunreachable symbolic states, which are expensive to validate manually. In the \nsecond part of this thesis, we propose a static approach to automatically \nvalidating the reported anomalous symbolic states. The validation makes use of \nthe available runtime data of the un-modeled APIs collected from previous \nprogram executions. We show that the symbolic state validation problem can be \ncast as a MAX-SAT problem and solved by existing constraint solvers. Our \ntechnique found 80 unreported bugs when it was applied to 10 popular programs \nwith a total of 1.5 million lines of code. All of them can be confirmed by test \ncases. Our technique presents a promising way to apply the big data paradigm to \nsoftware engineering. It provides a mechanism to validate the symbolic states \nof a project by leveraging the many concrete input-output values of APIs \ncollected from other projects.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tWednesday, 4 March 2015\n\nTime:\t\t\t5:00pm - 7:00pm\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3494\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nChairman:\t\tProf.  Weichuan Yu (ECE)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Shing-Chi Cheung (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Sunghun Kim\n \t\t\tProf. Charles Zhang\n \t\t\tProf. Wai-Ho Mow (ECE)\n \t\t\tProf. Michael Lyu (Comp.

They represent complex relationships among \nobserved variables and yet are computationally simple to work with.  When \nused for data analysis, they can identify meaningful groupings of observed \nvariables, where the correlations among the variables in each group can be \nmodeled by a single latent variable. As such, LTMs are effective tools for \ndetecting correlation patterns in data and can be applied to various \ndomains. In this thesis, we focus on developing new algorithms for \nlearning latent tree models and investigating their use in two \napplications.\n\nFirstly, we propose a new method called Bridged-Islands (BI) algorithm for \nlearning latent tree models. Many algorithms have been proposed for the \nsame task. However, previous methods for learning latent tree models have \ntheir limitations. For example, the search algorithms can only handle data \nsets with dozens of attributes. The algorithms based on attribute \nclustering (AC) usually focus on latent tree models with special \nstructures (e.g., binary trees or forests) which may be not appropriate \nfor many real world applications. The algorithms motivated by phylogenetic \ntree reconstruction (PTR) have restrictions on both observed and latent \nvariables. They normally require that all observed or latent variables \nhave the same number of states and the number should be known beforehand. \nCompared with AC-based algorithms and PTR-motivated algorithms, the \nadvantage of BI algorithm is model quality. It produces models with better \nquality and has no restrictions on the cardinalities of the observed \nvariables or latent variables. Compared with search algorithms, BI is more \nefficient and can be employed in larger data sets.\n\nSecondly, we propose a new LTM-based algorithm called hierarchical latent \ntree analysis (HLTA) for identifying topics from a collection of \ndocuments. The predominant method for topic detection is latent Dirichlet \nallocation (LDA), which assumes a generating process for the documents. \nHLTA provides an alternative view for topic detection. It identifies the \ntopics by simultaneously clustering the documents and word variables. In \nthis new view, a topic is considered as a class of documents that show \nclear thematic meaning. The new method models the word co-occurrence \npatterns by using a hierarchical latent tree model. Each latent variable \nrepresents a soft partition of the documents based on some word \nco-occurrence patterns. In the hierarchical structure, the variables at a \nhigher level correspond to more general topics, while the variables at a \nlower level correspond to more specific topics. Compared with alternative \nmethods, HLTA integrates topic correlation modeling, topic structure \ndetection and automatic determination of topic numbers in one framework. \nEmpirical experiments also show that the new algorithm produces more \nsemantically coherent topics and topic hierarchy than LDA-based methods.\n\nThirdly, we explore the use of LTMs for multidimensional clustering. \nConventional clustering usually assumes that there is only one true \nclustering within a data set, which does not hold for many real-world data \nthat are multifaceted. Multidimensional clustering aims to identify \nmultiple clusterings from the data. Latent tree models have previously \nbeen used for multidimensional clustering, where each latent variable in \nthe model represents one way to cluster the data. In this thesis, we apply \nthe new algorithm to the task and simultaneously deal with much larger \ndata sets than previously. We compared LTM-based methods with several \nalternative algorithms for multidimensional clustering on both labeled and \nunlabeled data sets. The empirical experiments indicate that the LTM-based \nmethods can identify a rich set of meaningful clusterings and concurrently \nachieve good performance.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 9 March 2015\n\nTime:\t\t\t3:00pm - 5:00pm\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 5503\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\n\nChairman:\t\tProf. Philip Mok (ECE)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Nevin Zhang (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Raymond Wong\n \t\t\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung\n \t\t\tProf. Weichuan Yu (ECE)\n \t\t\tProf. Joydeep Ghosh (Elec. & Comp.

The rapid development of microelectronic technology makes RFID tags \nsmaller, cheaper, and more powerful, especially in UHF passive RFID technology. \nThese remarkable technical advances have resulted in more and more supermarkets \nand libraries, such as Walt-Mart and university libraries, introducing RFID \ntechniques into their traditional systems. Utilizing these existing RFID \ninfrastructure to perform value-added services, such as user behavior analysis \nand item positioning, becomes a hot research topic, where indoor navigation \nusing UHF passive RFID system is the representational one.\n\nA typical process of indoor navigation service contains three periods: \nidentifying the user, positioning the user, and navigating the user. In our \nfirst work, we propose a user identification mechanism called OpenSesame, which \nemploys the users' waving patterns to identify the user. The key feature of \nthis work lies in using four fine-grained and statistic features of handwaving \nto verify users. In our second work, we propose BackPos, a fine-grained \nbackscatter positioning technique using the COTS RFID products with detected \nphases. Our studies show that the phase is a stable indicator highly related to \ntag's position and preserved over frequency or tag orientation, but challenged \nby its periodicity and tag's diversity. We attempt to infer the distance \ndifferences from phases detected by antennas under triangle constraint. \nFurther, hyperbolic positioning using the distance differences is employed to \nshrink the tag's candidate positions until finding out the real one. In our \nthird work, we propose RollCaller to utilize existing indoor objects with \nattached RFID tags and a reader to navigate users to their destinations, \nwithout need of any extra hardware. The key insight is that a person's movement \nhas an impact on the frequency shift values collected from indoor objects when \nclose to a tag. Such local human-item spatial relation is leveraged to infer \nthe user's position and further navigate the user to a destination step by \nstep.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 13 March 2015\n\nTime:                   3:00pm - 5:00pm\n\nVenue:                  Room 5503\n                         lifts 25/26\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Lionel Ni (Supervisor)\n  \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo (Chairperson)\n  \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\n \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Indoor Navigation Service using UHF Passive RFID"], "lenArticle": 382},

The categorization is yielded based on features and algorithms the \r\ndiverse object recognition methods utilize.\r\n\r\nIn place recognition, we study the problem of recognizing man-made objects and \r\npresent a novel affine-invariant feature, Low-rank SIFT, which exploits the \r\nregular appearance property in man-made objects. After an analysis on various \r\nfeatures representing the scene, we propose a novel feature which achieves full \r\naffine invariance without needing to simulate over affine parameter space. We \r\nrectify local patches by converting them to their low-rank forms to achieve \r\nskew invariance, and perform the way similar to conventional SIFT to resolve \r\nrotation, translation and scaling ambiguity. The main contributions lie in \r\ntwo-fold: our method seeks to leverage low-rank prior to estimate affine \r\nparameters for local patches directly and we propose a fast algorithm to \r\ncompute such parameters by introducing the Low-rank Integral Map.\r\n\r\nIn visual tracking, we propose two approaches. One utilizes generalized \r\npart-based appearance model and structure-constrained motion model as \r\nauxiliary. The appearance of the target object is modeled by the proposed \r\ngeneralized part-based appearance model, which combines the appearance of \r\ndifferent parts of the target object, adaptively updated by an efficient \r\nstructure learning scheme based on the online Passive-Aggressive algorithm. By \r\nintegrating the confidence scores of multiple parts, mutual compensation is \r\nrealized, significantly enhances the robustness of our method against the \r\nstructure deformation and partial occlusion during the tracking. In addition, \r\nwe enhance the performance of our tracker by using a motion model. It employs a \r\nstructure-constrained rule, that is, the change on the structure of the target \r\nobject between consecutive frames is small. Another tracking method leverages \r\nlayered detection that combines detection on two independent layers in a \r\nunified tracking-by-detection framework, one layer on the global level and the \r\nother on patch. Based on the bounding box representation for the object of \r\ninterest, the detection on the global level is formulated with the structured \r\nprediction framework that is superior for distinguishing the background and \r\nobject of interest during the tracking. For the patch level detection, an \r\nefficient patch level detector which is robust against the sampling error \r\nduring the online updating is proposed. With the patch level detector, \r\nconfidence estimation for the background and object of interest on patch level \r\nis carried out for the tracking. Comprehensive evaluations of our methods are \r\nconducted on a public benchmark for object tracking, and the experiment result \r\nshows that the proposed method using layer detection for object tracking \r\noutperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, with observable improvement \r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 17 March 2015\r\n\r\nTime:\t\t\t10:30am - 12:30pm\r\n\r\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3501\r\n \t\t\tLifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Long Quan (Supervisor)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Chiew-Lan Tai (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Huamin Qu\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Object tracking and recognition"], "lenArticle": 466},

These devices are envisioned as an increasingly \nimportant information interface between neighbouring users. A primary \ncornerstone of such applications is to build up a bridge connecting devices \nefficiently and effectively. In this thesis proposal, we address two \nchallenging topics in this area named neighbour discovery and spatial-awareness \ndevice interaction. In the first work, we design a deterministic neighbour \ndiscovery protocol named BlindDate for both asynchronous symmetry problem and \nasynchronous asymmetry problem. By theoretical analysis and extensive \nexperiments, Blind-Date is shown to guarantee the discovery latency as \n0.9*(1+d)^2*x^2 where d is a small fraction of slot length and 1/x is the duty \ncycle, which advances the state-of-the-art in both average performance \nand worst-case bound. In the second work, we are enlightened by the fact that \nneighbouring devices share similar ambient information as they are spatially \nclose. Thus, we design a novel neighbour discovery protocol named AIR that \nexploits ambient acoustic information to complete neighbour discovery in \nshorter time. AIR substantially increases the discovery probability of the \nfirst time they turn the radio on via low power acoustic sensing, which \nsignificantly decreases the average discovery latency. In the third work, we \npropose a novel system for initiating device interactions in close proximity \nwith zero prior configuration. We plan to utilise built-in microphones and \nspeakers on commodity devices for the purpose of initiating device interactions \nby a simple waving gesture.

With video content becoming \nincreasingly dominant and voluminous, the host-centric paradigm reveals \nits inefficiencies more seriously. In recent years, we have seen a variety \nof attempts to provide more efficient content delivery support for the \nInternet, including i) the research efforts of content-centric networking \n(CCN) as a clean-slate redesign of the Internet architecture; ii) the wide \nadoption of CDN services; and iii) the fast expansion of cloud \ninfrastructures offering vital support for modern data-intensive \napplications. We coin all these attempts to make the Internet a better \nplatform for content distribution as the \"content-oriented networks\". In \nthis thesis, we address several important resource management and \noptimization problems in those content-oriented networks.\n\nThis thesis consists of three parts. The first part is about content \nmanagement in CCN. One of the defining features of CCN is pervasive \nin-network caching. The original CCN proposal adopts the ubiquitous-LRU \ncaching scheme, which leads to serious on-path redundancy and poor overall \ncaching performance. We begin with proposing a new caching scheme PCP and \ndemonstrate via trace-driven simulations that PCP outperforms \nubiquitous-LRU in both microscopic and macroscopic views. Apart from PCP, \nmany other new caching schemes have also been proposed. Most of them \nincluding PCP focus on reducing on-path cache redundancy by invoking \neither explicit or implicit cooperations between nodes along the response \npath. This general approach inherently suffers from issues of scalability \nand hurdles of uniform enforcement across different ASes. To overcome \nthese limitations, we next propose an intra-AS cache cooperation scheme \niCCS, which commits to eliminating both on-path and off-path cache \nredundancy within an AS via a periodic independent procedure. We formulate \nthe cooperative redundancy elimination problem CRE-P and then propose a \ndistributed greedy algorithm. Through trace-based simulations on multiple \nrealistic network topologies, we show that iCCS significantly shortens the \nrequest-response latency and dramatically reduces the amount of transit \ntraffic without increasing internal link congestions. After that, we study \nthe content peering problem in CCN by proposing the content-level peering \nmodel (CPP). With extensive numerical experiments under realistic AS-level \npeering graphs, we find that interconnectivity of the peering graph \nsignificantly influences the maximum peering benefit, and that cooperative \ncaching yields higher peering benefits than local greedy caching but is \nsensitive to parameters like peering link bandwidth and AS-level cache \nsize. The second part is about content multi-homing with multiple CDNs. We \npropose the MCDN-CM model, aiming to make an optimal operating plan for \nthe authoritative CDN by deciding how to supply content requests with \nguaranteed QoS. We show via numerical experiments under realistic settings \nthat MCDN-CM achieves a tremendous cost-saving for the authoritative CDN \ncompared to other approaches. The third part is about traffic management \nin inter-data center network. We propose the MCTEQ model, which adopts \nutility-based joint-bandwidth allocation for multiple classes of traffic \nand in particular provides end-to-end delay guarantee for interactive \nflows. We demonstrate via experiments with two realistic inter-data center \nnetworks that MCTEQ achieves about 160 Gbps higher network utilization \nthan the best existing solutions, while running at least twice faster.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 24 March 2015\n\nTime:                   10:30am - 12:30pm\n\nVenue:                  Room 3494\n                        lifts 25/26\n\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Brahim Bensaou (Supervisor)\n  \t\t\tDr. Pan Hui (Chairperson)\n  \t\t\tProf. Gary Chan\n  \t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Resource management and optimization in content oriented networks"], "lenArticle": 596},

The \nmain difficulties have been the frame and the ramification problems. Current \nconsensus in the community is that to solve the ramification problem, a notion \nof causality is needed. As a result, there has been much work on causal action \ntheories and a variety of languages and semantics have been proposed. These \nexisting approaches basically all agree when the set of causal rules is \nstratified. However, when there are cycles in the rules, it is not always clear \nhow these rules are going to be represented according to these different \napproaches, and what the correct results are supposed to be.\n\nIn our work, we propose a new approach to charactorize and evaluate action \nlanguages, and apply this approach on two most representative action languages, \nB and C. First we consider a simple language for writing causal action \ntheories, and postulate several properties for the state transition models of \nthese theories. Then we propose to consider what we call permissible \ntranslations from these causal action theories to logic programs. We identify \ntwo sets of properties, and prove that for each set, there is only one \npermissible translation, under strong equivalence, that can satisfy all \nproperties in the set. As it turns out, for one set, the unique permissible \ntranslation is essentially the same as Balduccini and Gelfond's translation \nfrom Gelfond and Lifschitz's action language B to logic programs. For the \nother, it is essentially the same as Lifschitz and Turner's translation from \nthe action language C to logic programs. This work provides a new perspective \non understanding, evaluating and comparing action languages by using sets of \nproperties instead of examples, in the sense that other action languages can be \nsimilarly characterized, and new action languages defined using different sets \nof properties.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 26 March 2015\n\nTime:                   9:00am - 11:00am\n\nVenue:                  Room 3494\n                        lifts 25/26\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Fangzhen Li (Supervisor)\n  \t\t\tProf. Qiang Yang (Chairperson)\n  \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\n  \t\t\tProf. Nevin Zhang\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Characterizing Causal Action Theories by Translating Them to Logic Programs with Answer Set Semantics"], "lenArticle": 375},

Some popular types of LBS include \"search-nearby\" which \nsearches objects (e.g., restaurants, hotels and shops) near a location, \n\"spatial crowdsourcing\" which allows people to post tasks to be performed \nat a location (these people are called \"requesters\") and people to pick \nsome tasks to perform (these people are called \"workers\"), and \"trace \ntracking\" which records the trace of a movement (e.g., the moving trace of \na hiker). Each type of LBS usually relies on some computation based on \nspatial data (which is termed as spatial computation). For example, the \n\"search-nearby\" service relies on spatial keyword query to find all \nobjects that are near a given query location and contain a given query \nkeyword, the \"spatial crowdsourcing\" service relies on spatial matching to \nmatch between tasks and workers, and the \"trace tracking\" service relies \non trajectory data management.\n\nIn this thesis, we introduce three techniques for boosting the spatial \ncomputations that are central to LBSs, namely the collective spatial \nkeyword query which is one type of spatial keyword query and finds a set \nof spatial objects that cover all the given query keywords and have the \nsmallest distance from the query location, worst-case optimized spatial \nmatching which matches between two sets of spatial objects with the \nsmallest worst-case cost, and direction-preserving trajectory which \nsimplifies the trajectory while preserving the direction information \nembedded in the trajectory data.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 20 April 2015\n\nTime:                   3:00pm - 5:00pm\n\nVenue:                  Room 5503\n                        lifts 25/26\n\nCommittee Members:\tDr. Raymond Wong (Supervisor)\n  \t\t\tProf. Dimitris Papadias (Chairperson)\n  \t\t\tDr. Qiong Luo\n  \t\t\tDr. Ke Yi\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["ON BOOSTING SPATIAL COMPUTATIONS FOR LOCATION-BASED SERVICES"], "lenArticle": 301},

Listeners perceive strong \r\nemotions in music, and composers can create emotion-driven music. Researchers \r\nhave given more and more attention to this area because of the many interesting \r\napplications such as emotion-based music searching and automatic soundtrack \r\nmatching. These applications have motivated research on the correlation between \r\nmusic features such as timbre and emotion perception. Machine recognition \r\nmethods for music emotion have also been developed for automatically \r\nrecognizing affective musical content so that it can be indexed and retrieved \r\non large scale based on emotion.\r\n\r\nIn this research, our goal is to enable machine to automatically recognize \r\nmusic emotion. Therefore, we focus on two major topics: 1) understand the \r\ncorrelation between music emotion and timbre, 2) design algorithms for \r\nautomatic music emotion recognition.\r\n\r\nTo understand the correlation between music emotion and timbre, we designed \r\nlistening tests to compare sounds from eight wind and bowed string instruments. \r\nWe wanted to know if some sounds were consistently perceived as being happier \r\nor sadder in pairwise comparisons, and which spectral features were most \r\nimportant aside from spectral centroid. Therefore, we conducted listening tests \r\nof normal sounds, centroid-equalized sounds, as well as static sounds. Our \r\nresults showed strong emotional predispositions for each instrument, and that \r\nthe even/odd harmonic ratio is perhaps the most salient timbral feature after \r\nattack time and brightness.\r\n\r\nTo design algorithms for automatic music emotion recognition, we investigated \r\nmusic emotion's properties. We found that the major problem of automatic music \r\nemotion recognition is lack-of-data, which is due to 1) music emotion is \r\ngenre-specific, therefore labeled data for each music category is sparse; 2) \r\nmusic emotion is time-varying, and there is little time-varying labels for \r\nmusic emotion. Therefore, in our preliminary study, we have exploited unlabeled \r\nand social tagging data to alleviate problem 1). For problem 2), we have \r\nproposed to exploit time-sync comments data with a novel temporal and personal \r\ntopic model, and to exploit lyrics with a novel hierarchical Bayesian model.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tMonday, 27 April 2015\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3501\r\n                         lifts 25/26\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Andrew Horner (Supervisor)\r\n  \t\t\tProf. Qiang Yang (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Raymond Wong\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Machine Recognition of Music Emotion and the Correlation with Musical Timbre"], "lenArticle": 385},

In many multilabel \napplications, structures exist among labels. A popular structure on labels \nis the label hierarchy, which can be achieved with the help of domain \nexperts, or be automatically created from the data using procedures such \nas hierarchical clustering or Bayesian network structure learning. This \nlabel hierarchy may then be arranged as a tree, as in text categorization, \nor more generally, in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), as in the Gene \nOntology used in gene functional analysis. However, current research \nefforts typically ignore such label structures or can only exploit the \ndependencies in a label tree.\n\nIn this thesis, we introduce three methods that exploit the label \nstructure, either a tree or DAG, for multilabel classification. In the \nfirst work, we propose novel multilabel algorithms for the mandatory leaf \nnode prediction problem, in which the prediction paths of a given test \nexample are required to end at leaf nodes of the label hierarchy. This \nproblem setting is particularly useful when the leaf nodes have much \nstronger semantic meaning than the internal nodes.

However, on many \r\napplications, such human-intrinsic queries can be also answered by \r\nmachine-alone systems (i.e. CPUs). On the one hand, the latency of using \r\nHPUs to answer queries is much longer than that of CPUs, and the monetary \r\ncost of HPUs is often high (e.g. crowdsoucing on Amazon Mechanical Turk), \r\nbut on the other hand, the answers obtained from CPUs often have high \r\nuncertainty due to its incapability to recognize human-intrinsic \r\nsemantics.

Traditionally, top-k query processing was focused on \ndealing with the problem of multi-criteria decision making. However, when \nthe utility function is unknown, it cannot capture the users' requirements \nsince the utility function is regarded as a form of the users' \nrequirements. Recently, researchers proposed several novel top-k queries \nsuch as k-representative skyline queries and k-regret queries, which are \nregarded as the better solutions in the case that the utility function is \nunknown.\n\nNevertheless, it is still far away from the end of the story. Due to \nthe complexity issue, most of these novel top-k queries (without utility \nfunctions as inputs) cannot be directly applied to the large-scale data \nscenario. Specifically, the algorithms for answering these novel top-k \nqueries cannot be easily modified to run in a parallel and distributed \nplatform. Another problem is that most existing top-k queries are \nindependent of the users' requirements/information when the utility \nfunction is unknown. In general, even a user may not be able to provide an \nexact utility function, it is possible to obtain his/her partial \ninformation which can be used as the input of the queries so as to improve \nthe quality of the query answers. In the following, we propose two \ndirections for addressing the scalability and the personalization issue. \nOn one hand, it is possible to extend those traditional techniques for \ntop-k query processing in the large-scale data scenario. On the other \nhand, we could design a new type of top-k queries such that each newly \nproposed top-k query can be originally answered through a distributed \ncomputing platform and incorporates users' information into the answers. \nIn my thesis proposal, I mainly give an emphasis on the solutions towards \nthe above two directions.\n\nLastly, I include my research results on an application of top-k \nquery processing. In particular, I extend the idea of top-k query \nprocessing for sampling a training dataset of size k in the problem of \nclassification, one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning \nand data mining. The problem of classification can be studied in a big \ndata environment. When constructing a training dataset for classification, \na good sampling strategy is extremely crucial for determining the quality \nof the training dataset.

Compared with wired counterpart, wireless communication suffers a lot \nfrom the problems like interference in surrounding environment, low \ntransmission rate, etc. Research literature tries different ways of enhancing \nwireless network performance. Particularly in Physical layer (PHY), many novel \ntechnologies have been proposed, such as Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), \nzigzag decoding, full duplex antenna, etc.\n\nPursuing the same goal of enhancing wireless networking performance, two of my \nresearch projects, namely SimCast and TiM, enhance the performance of wireless \nnetworking in PHY.\n\nSimCast is a cross-layer design for achieving efficient concurrent video \nuploading/ downloading in MU-MIMO WLANs. Wireless video stream delivery is \nchoppy. This problem becomes much severer in MU-MIMO's simultaneous video \ntransmission within the same band. Conventional schemes achieve graceful video \ndelivery by harnessing from high data redundancy. However, with concurrent \ntransmission in the same band, the leverage of high data redundancy leads to \nhigh probability of collisions and packets loss, which limits the performance. \nIn concurrent video transmission, achieving efficiency over varied link \ncondition is the main issue. To address this issue, I propose SimCast\n(Simultaneous). The key idea of SimCast is to harness frequency diversity of \nthe channel and spatial similarity of users.\n\nTiM is a novel 3D modulation scheme to achieve fine-grained rate adaptation in \nwireless networking. Channel condition varies frequently in wireless networks. \nTo achieve good performance, devices need rate adaptation. In rate adaptation, \nchoosing proper modulation schemes based on channel conditions is vital to the \ntransmission performance. However, due to the natural character of discrete \nmodulation types and continuous varied link conditions, we cannot make a \none-to-one mapping from modulation schemes to channel conditions. This matching \ngap causes either over-select or underselect modulation schemes which limits \nthroughput performance. To fill-in the gap, I propose TiM (Time-line \nModulation), a novel 3-Dimensional modulation scheme by adding time dimension \ninto current amplitude-phase domain schemes. With estimation of channel \ncondition, TiM changes base-band data transmission time by artificially \ninterpolating values between original data points without changing \namplitude-phase domain modulation type.\n\nRecent research has extended the functionality of wireless signals into a new \nrealm. More precisely, they push the limit of ISM (Industrial Scientific and \nMedical) band from data delivery to radiometric detection, including motion \ndetection, recognition, localization, and even classification. By detecting and \nanalyzing signal reflection, these approaches enable Wi-Fi signals to \"See\" or \n\"Sense\" target objects. This kind of sensing works via wireless signals can be \ncollectively referred to as \"Wi-Fi Radar\".\n\nWiHear system follows the \"Wi-Fi Radar\" trend, which bridges communication \nbetween human speaking and wireless signals. My WiHear system enables Wi-Fi \nsignals to \"hear\" our talks without deploying any devices. To achieve this, \nWiHear needs to detect and analyze fine-grained radio reflections from mouth \nmovements.

In viewing this opportunity, the \nleading cross-bank settlement institute in China is looking for more business \nintelligence in their large-volume historical transaction data accumulated in \nmore than 10 years. Though a mature data warehousing solution Hive (an \nopen-source data warehousing solution built on top of Hadoop) is being adopted \nin production, the efficiency of data storage and processing is suboptimal due \nto the lack of advanced customization and optimization on the system. \nSpecifically, overlapping fractions of the original data set are materialized \nto different tables, introducing intra-table redundancy. Additions and changes \non columns inside a table also occur in an inconsistent manner during the over \n10-year history of the data sets, resulting in intra-table redundancy. Multiple \nuser groups with various levels of needs use different processing engines to \naccess the data sets, causing cross-platform redundancy and difficulty in \nsystem migration. Based on these observations, we propose an optimization \ndesign that is transparent to all users of the system. It exploits the inter- \nand intra-table redundancy to improve space efficiency. It also employs a \ncross-platform row columnar storage format to further improve the space \nefficiency and make the data accessible to multiple processing engines.

For many \nubiquitous computing applications, context awareness is critical for \nperformance optimization and user experience enrichment. Thanks to various \ntiny sensors embedded in devices such as smartphones, context information \ncan be obtained by directly sensing the running environment. However, it \nis difficult to sense some certain types of context. In this thesis, we \naddress three challenging topics of context sensing for ubiquitous \ncomputing, as briefed in the following.\n\nOur first work focuses on knowing user's location in indoor environments. \nMost of the current solutions rely on Received Signal Strength (RSS) of \nwireless signals as location fingerprint, where fingerprint uniqueness \nwith respect to locations is a basic assumption. However, due to practical \nlimitations in real-world deployment, such assumption does not always \nhold, which we refer to as fingerprint ambiguity. In this work, we study \nthe unexploited potential of user motion to resolve fingerprint ambiguity. \nOur basic idea is that user motion patterns collected by built-in sensors \nof mobile phones add to the fingerprint diversity. On this basis, we \npropose MoLoc, a motion-assisted localization scheme on mobile phones. The \nexperimental results show that MoLoc achieves a significant improvement \nover fingerprinting-based methods.\n\nOur second work addresses the problem of finding neighboring sensor nodes \nin the most energy-efficient way. We propose Hello, a generic flexible \nprotocol for neighbor discovery. With an unrestricted parameter, it serves \nas a generic framework that incorporates existing deterministic protocols. \nUnder the framework, we expose optimal parameters for either symmetric or \nasymmetric duty cycles, which is the first to our knowledge. The results \nfrom the simulation and real-world experiments show that Hello is highly \nenergy-efficient under both symmetric and asymmetric duty cycles.\n\nThe last work attempts to detect sleep stages for users to understand \ntheir sleep quality. We present SleepHunter, a mobile service that \nprovides a fine-grained detection of sleep stage transition for sleep \nquality monitoring and intelligent wake-up call. The rationale is that \neach sleep stage may be accompanied by specific and distinguishable body \nmovements and acoustic signals. Leveraging the built-in sensors on \nsmartphones, SleepHunter integrates these physical activities with sleep \nenvironment, inherent temporal relation and personal factors by a \nstatistical model. Experimental results from over 30 sets of nocturnal \nsleep data show that our system provides a significant improvement in \nterms of detection accuracy when compared with existing actigraphy-based \nsystems.\n\n\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 19 May 2015\n\nTime:\t\t\t2:00pm - 4:00pm\n\nVenue:\t\t\tRoom 3598\n \t\t\tLifts 27/28\n\nChairman:\t\tProf.  Ning Cai (IELM)\n\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Bo Li (Supervisor)\n \t\t\tProf. Kai Chen\n \t\t\tProf. Raymond Wong\n \t\t\tProf. Chin-Tau Lea (ECE)\n \t\t\tProf. Jianping Wang (CityU)\n\n\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Context Sensing for Ubiquitous Computing"], "lenArticle": 473},

The objective is to partition data into meaningful clusters, \r\nwhere the number of clusters might be known or unknown. A variety of \r\napproaches have been proposed for the task. Examples include \r\ndistance/similarity-based algorithms such as K-means, kernel K-means and \r\nspectral clustering, as well as model-based methods such as Gaussian \r\nmixture models (GMMs). Most previous clustering algorithms are targeted \r\nfor continuous data, that is, points in the Euclidean space of certain \r\ndimension. In this thesis, we focus on discrete data where each attribute \r\ntakes a finite number of possible values.\r\n\r\nA commonly used method for clustering discrete data is latent class \r\nanalysis (LCA). LCA is based on a class of finite mixture models known as \r\nlatent class models (LCMs). An LCM consists of a latent variable and a \r\nnumber of attributes. It assumes that the attributes are mutually \r\nindependent given the latent variable. Known as local independence, this \r\nassumption is often too strong in practice, and might lead to spurious \r\nclusters. Another method for clustering discrete data is called latent \r\ntree analysis (LTA) and it is based latent tree models (LTMs). LTMs allow \r\nmultiple latent variables and hence the local independence is relaxed. \r\nEach latent variable represents a soft partition of data. As such, LTA \r\nyields multiple partitions of data and is multidimensional clustering \r\nmethod. While multiple partitions are desirable in some applications, \r\nthere are many situations where one wants only one partition of data.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we develop and investigate a novel method for clustering \r\ndiscrete data that yields a single partition of data and does not make the \r\nlocal independence assumption. The method learns, from data, a three-level \r\nLTM where (1) the attributes are at the bottom, (2) there is a unique \r\nlatent variable, the root, at the top level, and (3) there are multiple \r\nlatent variables at the middle level that connect the attributes and the \r\nroot. The root represents the data partition to be obtained. It is not \r\ndirectly connected to the attributes, and hence the local independence \r\nassumption is relaxed. The method is called UC-LTM, which stands for \r\nunidimensional clustering based on latent tree models.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the general-purpose algorithm UC-LTM, we also propose and \r\ninvestigate a special-purpose unidimensional clustering method for solving \r\nthe rounding problem of spectral clustering. Spectral clustering starts \r\nwith a similarity matrix for a collection of data points, transforms the \r\nmatrix to get the so-called Laplacian matrix, finds the eigenvectors of \r\nthe Laplacian matrix, and obtains a partition of the data points using the \r\nleading eigenvectors. The last step is called rounding and it consists of \r\nthree sub-problems: (1) decide how many leading eigenvectors to use, (2) \r\ndetermine the number of clusters, and (3) partition the data points. To \r\nsolve the rounding problem, we treat the eigenvectors as features, \r\ndiscretize them, and then learn a three-level LTM to cluster the data \r\npoints. Our method differs from previous rounding methods in three ways. \r\nFirst, we relax the assumption that the number of clusters equals the \r\nnumber of eigenvectors used. Second, when deciding how many leading \r\neigenvectors to use, we not only rely on information contained in the \r\nleading eigenvectors themselves, but also make use of the subsequent \r\neigenvectors. Third, our method is model-based and solves all the three \r\nsub-problems simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tTuesday, 19 May 2015\r\n\r\nTime:                   3:00pm - 5:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 2132C\r\n                         lift 19\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Nevin Zhang (Supervisor)\r\n  \t\t\tProf. Fangzhen Lin (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Lei Chen\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Wilfred Ng\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Unidimensional Clustering using Latent Tree Models"], "lenArticle": 603},

Inspired by the effectiveness and aesthetic \r\nappeal of human line drawings, researchers have investigated algorithms \r\nfor generating line drawings from 3D meshes. Almost all such techniques \r\nfocus on only the end product; very few regard the line drawings as a \r\ncreative process. The creation process of a drawing provides a vivid \r\nvisual progression, allowing the audience to better comprehend the \r\ndrawing. It also enables numerous stroke-based rendering techniques.\r\n\r\nIn this dissertation, we address the problem of simulating the process of \r\nobservational drawing; that is, what and how people draw when sketching. \r\nGiven a 3D model and a viewpoint, our method synthesizes a visually \r\nplausible simulation of an observational sketching process. To \r\nconveniently change the view, we design a novel touch-based interface that \r\nsupports six degrees of freedom 3D direct manipulation while requires only \r\ntwo-finger operations.\r\n\r\nWe develop structure-aware shape analysis methods to obtain the intended \r\ndrawing trajectories, which address the question of what do people draw. \r\nApart from the trajectories which depict visual features using \r\nconventional local geometric properties, we focus more on the auxiliary \r\ntrajectories indicating the composition of the drawing. We extract \r\nauxiliary trajectories from contextual properties such as the topological \r\nlayout, proportions of object parts, fitted primitives, partial \r\nsymmetries, and levels of abstractions.\r\n\r\nWe develop the humanized stroke synthesis and stroke ordering methods to \r\naddress the question of how do people draw. The stroke synthesis method \r\nsimulates the action of a human moving a pen along an intended trajectory \r\nusing a feedback control system. It produces human-like tentative strokes \r\nwith inexact tracing and retracing effects. To assign a drawing order to \r\nthe strokes, we approximate the sketching process with an information \r\ndelivery process. A novel concept of the sketching entropy, which measures \r\nthe shape information of a stroke, is introduced. We obtain the complete \r\ndrawing order by requiring every next drawn stroke maximizes the \r\ninformation gain. Finally, we use the humanized strokes and their ordering \r\nto create the sketching animation.\r\n\r\nWe conduct a user study to evaluate the visual plausibility of the \r\nsimulated drawing processes and the effectiveness of our proposed method. \r\nExperiment confirms that our results are visually plausible.

Peer grading is \none vital issue for addressing the assessment challenge for open-ended \nassignments or exams while at the same time providing students with an \neffective learning experience through involvement in the grading process. \nMost existing MOOC platforms use simple schemes for aggregating peer \ngrades, e.g., taking the median or mean. To enhance these schemes, some \nrecent research attempts have developed machine learning methods under \neither the cardinal setting (for absolute judgment) or the ordinal setting \n(for relative judgment). In this thesis, we seek to study both cardinal \nand ordinal aspects of peer grading within a common framework. First, we \npropose novel extensions to some existing probabilistic graphical models \nfor cardinal peer grading. Not only do these extensions give superior \nperformance in cardinal evaluation, but they also outperform conventional \nordinal models in ordinal evaluation. Next, we combine cardinal and \nordinal models by augmenting ordinal models with cardinal predictions as \nprior. Such combination can achieve further performance boosts in both \ncardinal and ordinal evaluations, suggesting a new research direction to \npursue for peer grading on MOOCs. Extensive experiments have been \nconducted using real peer grading data from a course offered by HKUST on \nthe Coursera platform.

Previous methods and current baselines use relatively \nsimple machine learning models such as support vector machines and \nlogistic regression. They use various features that reflect the student \nactivities on a MOOC platform, including lecture video watching, forum \nactivities etc. Since these features are captured continuously during the \ncourse period, dropout prediction is essentially a time series prediction \nproblem.

It is widely used in a \nvariety of applications such as warehouse management, inventory control, \nobject tracking and localization, etc. RFID devices, especially tags, have \nsmall size and ultra-low power consumption. With such advantages, they are \nwell-suited to automatic inventory management in a large-scale. In \npractice, large-scale management in RFID systems is primarily comprised of \ntwo mainstreams, namely tag identification and estimation. Identification \nis a basic operation of collecting tag IDs to identify corresponding \nobjects. Estimation aims to count the number of tags quickly and \naccurately.\n\nIn this dissertation, we explore how to design effective protocols to \nbuild large-scale RFID management systems. The protocols, as introduced \nabove, address two fundamental problems in RFID systems, namely \nidentification and estimation. Both type of protocols should scale well to \nmassive tags.\n\nIn our first work, we investigate how to efficiently identify a large \namount of tags with one mobile reader that continuous changes its position \nto expand the coverage, denoted as the continuous scanning problem. We \nobserve that the performance of continuous scanning protocol depends on \nthe spatial distribution of tags in two adjacent scans. An adaptive \ncontinuous scanning protocol is proposed that selects the best scanning \nstrategy according to the current spatial distribution of tags.\n\nIn our second work, we study the conventional RFID estimation problem. We \nnotice that existing estimation approaches merely provide asymptotic \nresults of estimation time, but fail to give tight bounds for the \nconvergence rate of corresponding algorithms. We propose an estimation \nscheme that achieves Arbitrarily Accurate Approximation (A3) for the tag \npopulation size. More importantly, we give an rigorous bound O((loglog \nn+\u03b5-2)log\u03b4-1) in its communication time, for a given (\u03b5,\u03b4) accuracy \nrequirement.\n\nIn our last work, we explore a generalized RFID estimation problem named \nGeneric Composite Counting. The conventional RFID estimation problem \nfocuses on counting the number of tags in a single tag set, or at most the \nunion of multiple tag sets. This simple scenario is far from enough to \nmeet various application demands.

To support the ever-growing cloud computing needs, \r\nthe number of physical servers and virtual machines in today's data \r\ncenters are increasing exponentially, which in turn leads to enormous \r\nchallenges in designing cost-effective data center networks (DCN) and \r\nefficient resource sharing via network provisioning. With data \r\navailability and security at stake, the issues with data center networks \r\nare more critical than ever. As one of the most important determinants of \r\nnetwork performance, the data center network architecture plays a dominate \r\nrole in determining the system reliability, network capacity, latency and \r\neven the routing efficiency. With this motivation, in this thesis paper, \r\nwe firstly present the design, implementation and evaluation of SprintNet, \r\na novel server-centric network architecture for data centers. SprintNet \r\nachieves high performance in network capacity, fault tolerance, and \r\nnetwork latency. SprintNet is also a scalable, yet low-diameter network \r\narchitecture where the longest path length can be limited by four hops and \r\nis independent of the number of layers. In response to the critical \r\nshortcomings of the server-centric architectures, we then propose an \r\neffective hardware based approach to solve these issues and improve the \r\nnetwork efficiency. Afterwards, we design two torus-based DCN \r\narchitectures named NovaCube and CLOT, where the torus topology well \r\nimplements the network locality forming the servers in close proximity of \r\neach other, which increases the communication efficiency. Moreover, in the \r\nhighly multiplexed shared cloud data centers, in order to efficiently \r\nshare the physical network resources among multiple tenants that have \r\ndiversified virtual network topologies with different network \r\ncharacteristics, in this thesis we then propose an efficient online \r\nheuristic virtual network embedding framework called Presto. Presto \r\noperates with quite low computation complexity and greatly reduces the \r\nsearch space, which far outperforms other candidates. The goal of Presto \r\nis to maximize the economic revenue of infrastructure providers and \r\nincrease the resource utilization while minimizing the embedding cost. \r\nFinally, we propose two efficient heuristic schemes to achieve an energy \r\nproportional data center network from the perspective of resource \r\nallocation, routing and flow scheduling, without compromising throughput \r\nand fault tolerance too much. Both theoretical analysis and extensive \r\nsimulations have been conducted to evaluate the overall performance and \r\neffectiveness of these proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tThursday, 28 May 2015\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 2132B\r\n                         lift 19\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Mounir Hamdi (Supervisor)\r\n  \t\t\tProf. Qian Zhang (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tDr. Brahim Bensaou\r\n  \t\t\tDr. Jogesh Muppala\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["On the Efficiency of Network Architecture and Network Provisioning in Cloud Data Centers"], "lenArticle": 449},

Despite their usefulness, whether they are sufficient for \r\nunderstanding and diagnosing the strengths and weaknesses of different trackers \r\nremains questionable.  To address this issue, we propose a framework by \r\nbreaking a tracker down into five constituent parts, namely, motion model, \r\nfeature extractor, observation model, model updater, and ensemble \r\npost-processor.  We then conduct ablative experiments on each component to \r\nstudy how it affects the overall result.  Surprisingly, our findings are \r\ndiscrepant with some common beliefs in the visual tracking research community. \r\nWe find that the feature extractor plays the most important role in a tracker. \r\nOn the other hand, although the observation model is the focus of many studies, \r\nwe find that it often brings no significant improvement.  Moreover, the motion \r\nmodel and model updater contain many details that could affect the result. \r\nAlso, the ensemble post-processor can improve the result substantially when the \r\nconstituent trackers have high diversity.  Based on our findings, we put \r\ntogether some very elementary building blocks to give a basic tracker which is \r\ncompetitive in performance to the state-of-the-art trackers.  We believe our \r\nframework can provide a solid baseline when conducting controlled experiments \r\nfor visual tracking research.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate:\t\t\tFriday, 29 May 2015\r\n\r\nTime:                   2:00pm - 4:00pm\r\n\r\nVenue:                  Room 3584\r\n                         lifts 27/28\r\n\r\nCommittee Members:\tProf. Dit-Yan Yeung (Supervisor)\r\n  \t\t\tProf. Albert Chung (Chairperson)\r\n \t\t\tProf. Chiew-Lan Tai\r\n  \t\t\tProf. Nevin Zhang\r\n\r\n\r\n**** ALL are Welcome ****\n", "type": "Thesis Defense", "name": ["Understanding and Diagnosing Visual Tracking Systems"], "lenArticle": 255},

Debugging is a hard \njob for programmers, and its efficiency still heavily depends on \nprogrammers' insight and their experiences, even in the presence of a host \nof debugging tools and theories.This works aims to build an operational semantic framework for \nautomated debugging. We divide a general debugging process into three \nphases: tracing process, locating process, and fixing process. The first \ntwo phases are accomplished by a tracing procedure and a locating \nprocedure, respectively. The tracing procedure reproduces the execution of \nthe successful test cases with well-designed data structures, and saves \nnecessary information for the locating procedure.The locating procedure will use the information obtained by the tracing \nprocedure to locate ill-designed statements and generates an equation \nsystem, which will be used to fix the bug. We provide a structural \noperational semantics with trace stacks, to define the functions of the \ntracing procedure. We also give a structural operational semantics for \ndebugging, to specify the functions of locating procedure. We show that \nboth procedures guarantee to terminate.It turns out that for a given successful test case, there exist three \ndifferent types of solutions: 1. the bug is solvable, and the program can \nbe repaired; 2. there exists a structural design error in the program; \nwhile the equations generated at each round of the locating procedure are \nsolvable, a new bug may arise when fixing the old bug; and 3. there exists \na logical design error, and the fixing equations are not solvable.The fundamental feature of the quantum world is its uncertainty, whose \nstrangeness is usually beyond the comprehensions of the people from the \nclassical world.

The project shows \nthat it is possible to find topically related long texts which can be \nutilized as the auxiliary data when mining the target short texts data. It \npresents a novel approach to cluster short text messages via transfer \nlearning from auxiliary long text data. To accommodate the possible \ninconsistencies between source and target data, a novel topic model Du-al \nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (DLDA) model is proposed to jointly learn two \nsets of topics on short and long texts and couple the topic parameters to \ncope with the potential inconsistencies between data sets. Through \nlarge-scale clustering experiments on both advertisements and Twitter \ndata, superior performance over several state-of-art techniques for \nclustering short text documents can be obtained.900 submissions were received in the CIKM this year while only 134 \n(less than 15%) out of which were accepted as long papers with oral \npresentation.

The conversions \nfrom color image to grayscale are indispensable in image processing \nconsidering the essential role played by grayscale images in image \npreprocessing and grayscale printing.

{"description": "Hackathon@HKUST is the event organized by CSE Entrepreneurship Club \n(E-Club), a student-driven interest group with a mission to promote \nentrepreneurship within and beyond the CSE community. This student and \nalumni activity is in collaboration of MBA Technology Club, E-Academy, \nComputer Science and Engineering Alumni Association and various sponsoring \ncompanies and organisations.The second information session was held on 3 April 2014 at HKUST. There \nwas a long queue in the registration counter, but it did not hinder the \nenthusiasm of participants. It was a fantastic event with more than 100 \nparticipants filling up the LTG. Participants were students, alumni and \nguests taking up roles of programmer, designer and \nbusinessman/businesswoman.The event started with a briefing session about Hackathon@HKUST 2014 \nand its rules, regulations, the judging panel, the judging criteria, and \nthe Q & A session. It was followed by a presentation of inspiring \ntopics given by Professor Po Chi Wu, Adjunct Professor of Mechanical and \nAerospace Engineering. After that, groups of 10-12 participants were \nformed and they were given a chance to brainstorm the solutions for the \nproblems we had given, and followed by group presentations. The \nice-breaking session helped participants with different background mingle \ntogether.The information session ended with a free networking session with \nrefreshments. Participants were free to chat with other students, alumni, \ninvited speakers and executive committee members. They could also find \npartners who are interested in working with, brainstorm ideas, build their \nown team, and even work out a preparation plan for the Hackathon \nevent.\nThere is a lot of hidden talent and ideas here at HKUST. There is also a \nlot of potential for collaboration among students, across departments and \nwith our alumni. I believe that Hackathon@HKUST will be a pioneering event \n- an opportunity to connect students, ignite their ideas and broaden their \nhorizons. This event will also help connect HKUST with the Hong Kong \nstartup community. It's great to see the positive response we got so far. \nLastly, I would like to thank Peter Chung, the Program Coordinator of the \nCSE E-Club, for his dedication and invaluable support throughout the \nlaunch of the CSE E-Club and preparation of Hackathon@HKUST.\n\nI do think that we have to clearly distinguish between being an \nentrepreneur and having entrepreneurial mindset. While being entrepreneurs \nis too risky for some, having entrepreneurial mindset doesn't give you any \nrisk and makes your life and others life better. One of the part that has \nbeen missing is the chance for people to ignite their ideas, that's why \npeople come up with ideas that soon are forgotten. Hackathon@HKUST enables \npeople to get their ideas kick-started, and hopefully the solution that \nthey build will benefit the society. I think this is a great way to push \nthe human being forward and I am proud to be a part of it.\n\nWith the upcoming Hackathon, we are aiming to excite participants about \nentrepreneurship, connect students across departments and levels of \nexperience, enable ideation, and foster creativity.\nSeeing the enthusiasm and the participation level at the info session \nassured me that we have an exciting Hackathon weekend ahead.\nSee the details of .For enquiries, please feel free to contact:\nPeter Chung\nProgram Coordinator\nCSE Entrepreneurship Club\nEmail: \n", "lenArticle": 530, "date": "2014-04-09", "type": "News", "vaderSentiment": {"neg": 0.041, "neu": 0.773, "pos": 0.186, "compound": 0.9982}, "name": ["The Second Information Session of Hackathon@HKUST 2014"]},
