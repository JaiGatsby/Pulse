practitioners participate in the contest over the years, and the KDDCUP 
datasets have become benchmarks for the data mining field. ACM KDDCUP 
Contest 2005 was held between May and July 2005 by the ACM Special 
Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining which was aimed at 
solving a difficult and practical problem in Internet search, for the 
classification of 800,000 realistic Internet search queries. A good 
solution to this problem will help improve the current internet search and 
information retrieval technology. Many teams around the world completed 
event and 37 solutions were submitted. Solutions include the design and 
implementation of algorithms based on artificial intelligence, statistics, 
database and information retrieval technologies. This year's tasks are 
particularly challenging due to the large size of the search problem and 
the lack of training data that are usually given in data mining problems.

,"Colleagues and students are cordially invited to attend a lecture given 
by Chinese Academician on 4 November 2011 (Friday)., for the talk.,A debugging process starts when a successful test case finds that its 
outcome is not consistent with the expected results. Debugging is a hard 
job for programmers, and its efficiency still heavily depends on 
programmers' insight and their experiences, even in the presence of a host 
of debugging tools and theories.,This works aims to build an operational semantic framework for 
automated debugging. We divide a general debugging process into three 
phases: tracing process, locating process, and fixing process. The first 
two phases are accomplished by a tracing procedure and a locating 
procedure, respectively. The tracing procedure reproduces the execution of 
the successful test cases with well-designed data structures, and saves 
necessary information for the locating procedure.,The locating procedure will use the information obtained by the tracing 
procedure to locate ill-designed statements and generates an equation 
system, which will be used to fix the bug. We provide a structural 
operational semantics with trace stacks, to define the functions of the 
tracing procedure. We also give a structural operational semantics for 
debugging, to specify the functions of locating procedure. We show that 
both procedures guarantee to terminate.,It turns out that for a given successful test case, there exist three 
different types of solutions: 1. the bug is solvable, and the program can 
be repaired; 2. there exists a structural design error in the program; 
while the equations generated at each round of the locating procedure are 
solvable, a new bug may arise when fixing the old bug; and 3. there exists 
a logical design error, and the fixing equations are not solvable.,The fundamental feature of the quantum world is its uncertainty, whose 
strangeness is usually beyond the comprehensions of the people from the 
classical world. As our exploration in the quantum world grows deeper, we 
naturally look forward to new technologies based on its unique characters, 
with the aim to apply these novel technologies in the classical world of 
certainty. This leads to the birth of quantum information. In this 
presentation, I will first discuss briefly the intriguing features of the 
quantum world, and then introduce the fundamental principles as well as 
the latest development for quantum cryptography and quantum computation.",Talks by Chinese Academicians

understanding short texts is becoming more and more important. For short 
text messages, most of the existing text mining techniques are not 
effective due to the sparseness of text representations. The project shows 
that it is possible to find topically related long texts which can be 
utilized as the auxiliary data when mining the target short texts data. It 
presents a novel approach to cluster short text messages via transfer 
learning from auxiliary long text data. To accommodate the possible 
inconsistencies between source and target data, a novel topic model Du-al 
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (DLDA) model is proposed to jointly learn two 
sets of topics on short and long texts and couple the topic parameters to 
cope with the potential inconsistencies between data sets. Through 
large-scale clustering experiments on both advertisements and Twitter 
data, superior performance over several state-of-art techniques for 
clustering short text documents can be obtained.,900 submissions were received in the CIKM this year while only 134

project focuses on the Order-Preserving SubMatrix (OPSM) pattern which is 
previously shown to be an effective tool for analyzing gene expression 
data. The OPSM pattern is generalized in three directions. First, the 
definition of OPSM pattern was relaxed by allowing a reasonable amount of 
fluctuation inside the pattern so that it becomes more robust in noisy 
gene data. Second, the data matrix was generalized to allow continuous 
distribution so that it can be applied to application with uncertain data 
like RFID tracking. Finally, the model was generalized to the mine OPSM 
patterns from recommender system with large and sparse rating matrices by 
allowing missing entries in the OPSM patterns which can be mined by an

Meta-word Model (MWM), the Term-URL Model (TUM), and the Clickthrough 
Model (CTM), to analyze search engine query log. MWM unifies the 
co-occurrence of query terms and URLs by the meta-word occurrence. TUM 
captures the characteristics of query terms and URLs separately. CTM 
captures the clicking behavior explicitly and models the ternary relation 
between search queries, query terms and URLs. The three proposed models 
are evaluated against several strong baselines on a real-life commercial

Image Decolorization"" supervised by Prof Chiew-lan Tai. The conversions 
from color image to grayscale are indispensable in image processing 
considering the essential role played by grayscale images in image 
preprocessing and grayscale printing. However, salient features of color 
image often disappear in the grayscale result due to some avoidable or 
unavoidable loss of information in the conversion. This paper presents 
three robust and efficient color-to-grayscale algorithms based on the 
algorithm presented by Kim et al. Compared to the original work which 
considers only the local differences, Zhinan takes the global differences 
into account. Specifically, he devises three different methods that 
consider statistics from the image in CIE Lch, in RGB color spaces and 
consider differences of random chosen pixel by Gaussian pairing.,With the project ""RFID Noise Identification Using Classification"" 
supervised by Prof Wilfred Ng, Zhijun entered the final round of the 
competition. The project is about noise identification in radio-frequency

lot of potential for collaboration among students, across departments and 
with our alumni. I believe that Hackathon@HKUST will be a pioneering event 
- an opportunity to connect students, ignite their ideas and broaden their 
horizons. This event will also help connect HKUST with the Hong Kong 
startup community. It's great to see the positive response we got so far. 
Lastly, I would like to thank Peter Chung, the Program Coordinator of the 
CSE E-Club, for his dedication and invaluable support throughout the 
launch of the CSE E-Club and preparation of Hackathon@HKUST.

I do think that we have to clearly distinguish between being an 
entrepreneur and having entrepreneurial mindset. While being entrepreneurs 
is too risky for some, having entrepreneurial mindset doesn't give you any 
risk and makes your life and others life better. One of the part that has 
been missing is the chance for people to ignite their ideas, that's why 
people come up with ideas that soon are forgotten. Hackathon@HKUST enables 
people to get their ideas kick-started, and hopefully the solution that 
they build will benefit the society. I think this is a great way to push 
the human being forward and I am proud to be a part of it.
,
With the upcoming Hackathon, we are aiming to excite participants about 
entrepreneurship, connect students across departments and levels of 
experience, enable ideation, and foster creativity.
,Seeing the enthusiasm and the participation level at the info session 
assured me that we have an exciting Hackathon weekend ahead.

Coolstreaming system was the data-driven overlay, also referred as 
swarming, which utilized a distributed gossip protocol to explore content 
availability with a small set of neighbors to form a random overlay for 
video retrieval. It resulted in a breakthrough from the conventional video 
broadcast paradigm in that some forms of multicast trees must be used. The 
random overlay in Coolstreaming achieved superior scaling comparing to the 
then state-of-the-art technologies. It made a quantum lump from supporting 
only hundreds of viewers to hundreds of thousands of viewers in the 
original Coolstreaming system reported in this work appeared in IEEE

scale to support millions of viewers.,The IEEE INFOCOM Test-of-Time Paper Award is newly launched this year to

Technology Key Laboratory, ,, two 
excellent researchers from Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), , 
and , gave talks on the theme of ""Are We Read for the Age of AI"" to HKUST 
students and faculty. Two researchers shared their latest research progress 
in artificial intelligence including video understanding, deep learning, 
NLP, knowledge engineering and machine learning.,The Principal Researcher, Dr. Chin-Yew Lin, gave a talk titled "","". In 
his talk, Dr. Lin With discussed the availability of personal agents such 
as Cortana, Siri and Google. Now, it seems a world of humans and machines 
communicate and solve problems together in natural language is not far 
away. The scene of freely chatting with HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey and 
Samantha in Her could happen to us seems within reach. The question is are 
we ready to go there? He used solving math number word problem as an 
example to show how the emerging NLP, knowledge engineering and machine 
learning technologies can pay the way to this holy grail and what 
challenges that we have to address to travel down the path?,The leader researcher, Dr. Tao Mei gave a talk titled "","". In his talk, he pointed out that the progress made in deep 
learning has advanced the research in video analysis. For humans, it is 
very easy to understand videos since we can easily capture the video even 
when we were just born and we can capture and recognize each dynamic figure 
in our view. However, it is very difficult for computers to recognize 
screen content and capture motions, which need tremendous computation to 
implement. When a computer recognizes some keywords from the video, due to 
the complexity of the semantics and sentence structure, also tenses and 
plural forms, it is much more difficult for a computer to organize single 
words into a semantic meaningful sentence. Dr. Tao demonstrated his latest 
research progress in deep learning for video content analysis. His 
multimedia research group has achieved the world's best experimental 
results and their algorithms are considered as the best for video 
understanding.,HKUST and MSRA have been collaborated for 15 years on promoting the 
cutting-edge research in IT. The joint Laboratory Director Professor Lei 
Chen said that their goal is not only to publish in top journals and 
conferences, but also to make the results of the research have a positive 
and long-term impact on the whole society.,On the same day, HKUST Microsoft Student Club was formally established.
