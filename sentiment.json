The conversions \nfrom color image to grayscale are indispensable in image processing \nconsidering the essential role played by grayscale images in image \npreprocessing and grayscale printing.

{"date": "2011-10-28", "description": "Colleagues and students are cordially invited to attend a lecture given \nby Chinese Academician on 4 November 2011 (Friday). for the talk.A debugging process starts when a successful test case finds that its \noutcome is not consistent with the expected results. Debugging is a hard \njob for programmers, and its efficiency still heavily depends on \nprogrammers' insight and their experiences, even in the presence of a host \nof debugging tools and theories.This works aims to build an operational semantic framework for \nautomated debugging. We divide a general debugging process into three \nphases: tracing process, locating process, and fixing process. The first \ntwo phases are accomplished by a tracing procedure and a locating \nprocedure, respectively. The tracing procedure reproduces the execution of \nthe successful test cases with well-designed data structures, and saves \nnecessary information for the locating procedure.The locating procedure will use the information obtained by the tracing \nprocedure to locate ill-designed statements and generates an equation \nsystem, which will be used to fix the bug. We provide a structural \noperational semantics with trace stacks, to define the functions of the \ntracing procedure. We also give a structural operational semantics for \ndebugging, to specify the functions of locating procedure. We show that \nboth procedures guarantee to terminate.It turns out that for a given successful test case, there exist three \ndifferent types of solutions: 1. the bug is solvable, and the program can \nbe repaired; 2. there exists a structural design error in the program; \nwhile the equations generated at each round of the locating procedure are \nsolvable, a new bug may arise when fixing the old bug; and 3. there exists \na logical design error, and the fixing equations are not solvable.The fundamental feature of the quantum world is its uncertainty, whose \nstrangeness is usually beyond the comprehensions of the people from the \nclassical world. As our exploration in the quantum world grows deeper, we \nnaturally look forward to new technologies based on its unique characters, \nwith the aim to apply these novel technologies in the classical world of \ncertainty.

As \nrelated by one of his students, Prof Golin \"always explains difficult \nconcepts with interesting stories.\"Apart from his contextual approach to pedagogy, Prof Golin impresses \nhis students and colleagues with his unparalleled devotion to teaching and \nprogram development. His obsession with giving his students the best he \ncan is almost contagious. During his career at HKUST he has created many \nnew courses and developed both new Postgraduate and Undergraduate \nprograms.His current task is the development of the new Bachelor in Computer \nScience program which, for the first time, allows Computer Science \nstudents from the School of Engineering to also take a second concurrent \nmajor in a science subject, notably Mathematics or Physics. Due to the \ndiffering nature of the majors involved, Prof Golin has to work \nindividually with students to develop personalized programs that match \ntheir own specific backgrounds, constraints and goals for the future.Despite the work involved, Prof Golin finds the experience gratifying. \n\"It is fascinating to build programs that work properly,\" remarked Prof \nGolin, \"There's no greater pleasure than to see my students grow and \ndevelop intellectually and a well-designed program gives them that \nopportunity\".After all his time as an academic, Prof Golin remains passionate about \nhis role as a teacher and convinced about the essence of education - that \nis the task of helping students \"learn, understand and grow.\"", "vaderSentiment": {"neg": 0.02, "neu": 0.805, "pos": 0.175, "compound": 0.9969}, "name": ["Professor Mordecai Golin awarded the Michael G Gale Medal for \nDistinguished Teaching (2008)"], "lenArticle": 411},

The \npaper is accepted by CVPR 2012 and Qifeng will join the conference in \nprovidence, Rhode Island, USA in June. Qifeng has just accepted a PhD \noffer from Stanford University.LI Yuliang won the 3rd place with his project \"Mining Generalized \nOrder-Preserving SubMatrices from Gene Expression Data\" supervised by Prof \nWilfred NG. The submatrix mining problems, which are also known as \nbiclustering, have been extensively studied. A submatrix pattern consists \nof a set of rows that shares common behaviour across a set of columns, \nwhich reveals interesting local correlations in the data matrix. The \nproject focuses on the Order-Preserving SubMatrix (OPSM) pattern which is \npreviously shown to be an effective tool for analyzing gene expression \ndata. The OPSM pattern is generalized in three directions. First, the \ndefinition of OPSM pattern was relaxed by allowing a reasonable amount of \nfluctuation inside the pattern so that it becomes more robust in noisy \ngene data. Second, the data matrix was generalized to allow continuous \ndistribution so that it can be applied to application with uncertain data \nlike RFID tracking. Finally, the model was generalized to the mine OPSM \npatterns from recommender system with large and sparse rating matrices by \nallowing missing entries in the OPSM patterns which can be mined by an \ninnovative fast heuristic algorithm.The award presentation ceremony was held on 19 April 2012 at HKUST.", "vaderSentiment": {"neg": 0.023, "neu": 0.812, "pos": 0.165, "compound": 0.9943}, "name": ["2012 Mr Armin and Mrs Lillian Kitchell Undergraduate Research Award"], "lenArticle": 355},

Two researchers shared their latest research progress \nin artificial intelligence including video understanding, deep learning, \nNLP, knowledge engineering and machine learning.The Principal Researcher, Dr. Chin-Yew Lin, gave a talk titled \"\". In \nhis talk, Dr. Lin With discussed the availability of personal agents such \nas Cortana, Siri and Google. Now, it seems a world of humans and machines \ncommunicate and solve problems together in natural language is not far \naway. The scene of freely chatting with HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey and \nSamantha in Her could happen to us seems within reach. The question is are \nwe ready to go there? He used solving math number word problem as an \nexample to show how the emerging NLP, knowledge engineering and machine \nlearning technologies can pay the way to this holy grail and what \nchallenges that we have to address to travel down the path?The leader researcher, Dr. Tao Mei gave a talk titled \"\". In his talk, he pointed out that the progress made in deep \nlearning has advanced the research in video analysis. For humans, it is \nvery easy to understand videos since we can easily capture the video even \nwhen we were just born and we can capture and recognize each dynamic figure \nin our view. However, it is very difficult for computers to recognize \nscreen content and capture motions, which need tremendous computation to \nimplement. When a computer recognizes some keywords from the video, due to \nthe complexity of the semantics and sentence structure, also tenses and \nplural forms, it is much more difficult for a computer to organize single \nwords into a semantic meaningful sentence. Dr. Tao demonstrated his latest \nresearch progress in deep learning for video content analysis. His \nmultimedia research group has achieved the world's best experimental \nresults and their algorithms are considered as the best for video \nunderstanding.HKUST and MSRA have been collaborated for 15 years on promoting the \ncutting-edge research in IT. The joint Laboratory Director Professor Lei \nChen said that their goal is not only to publish in top journals and \nconferences, but also to make the results of the research have a positive \nand long-term impact on the whole society.On the same day, HKUST Microsoft Student Club was formally established. \nThis is MSRA's first student club outside mainland China.
